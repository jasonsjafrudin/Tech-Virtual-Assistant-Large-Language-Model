Johnson      -  Sep 23, 2016 3:38 pm UTC Enlarge / The Transantarctic Mountains.NASA/Jim Yungel reader comments6Share this storySince 1984, researchers have been arguing about what to make of tiny ocean plankton shells sitting atop the Transantarctic Mountains. That is obviously not a place plankton would call home, so how did they get there? And what might their presence tell us about Antarctica\\u2019s past?The researchers who initially discovered the surprise diatom shells found them mixed in with glacially deposited sediment. They argued that\\u00a0the shells told a pretty big story. Around 3 million years ago, when these species of diatom were alive, we know there were several periods of climatic warmth. During these periods, the researchers said, the Antarctic ice sheets must have \\u201ccollapsed\\u201d down to a much smaller size, opening basins in the interior of the continent that flooded with seawater. That is where these diatoms would have lived, piling up at the bottom of the seaway when they died.When the climate cooled, the ice would have advanced back into these basins, scraping up diatoms and sediment and pushing it up against the Transantarctic Mountains\\u2014where it was perhaps lifted to even higher elevation by tectonic uplift of the landscape. This would require a much more dynamic ice sheet than most glaciologists expected, vulnerable to warmth that would drive serious melting\\u00a0and raise sea levels significantly.This hypothesis\\u00a0proved controversial, and other researchers argued forcefully that other, less extraordinary explanations were possible. The debate formed two camps\\u2014the \\u201cstabilists\\u201d who favored alternate explanations that didn\\u2019t involve large-scale retreats of Antarctic ice, and the \\u201cdynamicists.\\u201dFollow-up studies seemed to swing things toward the stabilists. The diatoms were actually concentrated in the surface layer of the glacial sediments, for example, implying that they had separately been deposited on top\\u2014perhaps carried by wind. And model simulations of Antarctica\\u2019s ice didn't produce a\\u00a0massive retreat when fed\\u00a0the conditions of the Pliocene 3 million years ago.A new study led by Northern Illinois University\\u2019s Philip Scherer attempts to revisit the mystery of the stranded plankton, testing a sort of compromise hypothesis between the two camps. Even if the diatoms were blown up there on the wind, the stubborn fact remains that marine diatoms aren\\u2019t really found anywhere else in Antarctica. You can find the occasional diatom in the Antarctic snow, but they are all continental species from sources far away (or the one place in Antarctica that isn\\u2019t covered in ice\\u2014the McMurdo Dry Valleys). It\\u2019s easy for wind to pick up dried-out diatoms, but it\\u2019s not going to blow them straight out of ocean water. So how\\u00a0were marine diatoms ending up on the winds of 3 million years ago?The first step in answering that question was to turn to the latest-and-greatest Antarctic ice sheet model simulation of the Pliocene warm periods. That model produces much more retreat than earlier efforts, better matching records of sea level from that time. The sensitive West Antarctic Ice Sheet basically disappears, but two important coastal sections of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet also retreat more than 500km inland across lowlands, which\\u00a0then\\u00a0become bays. Altogether, this raises global sea level by about 17 meters compared to the present day.Further ReadingUpdated ice sheet model matches wild swings in past sea levelsThe mass of thick ice sheets actually depresses the Earth\\u2019s crust downward beneath them, and the opposite happens when ice melts away\\u2014the land surface rebounds upward. The model simulation does this, too, and that\\u2019s where the diatom story comes in.During the retreat, these growing bays would be nutrient-rich plankton havens. But a\\u00a0few thousand years after the ice retreats into those new bays, some areas near the old coastline rebound above sea level, becoming exposed land. So the newly exposed land would probably be covered in sediment loaded up with marine diatom shells, all dried out and ready to be picked up by the wind.Enlarge / The outline of a simulated Antarctic ice sheet shrunken by Pliocene warmth. Brown areas have rebounded above sea level several thousand years after the ice disappeared. Bright red dots mark locations in the Transantarctic Mountains where marine diatom shells have been found.Scherer et al., Nature Communications, 2016For the final step, the researchers ran a climate model simulation of the atmosphere over this changed Antarctic continent. While the winds at the surface mainly blew outward toward the coast (and down-slope), the pattern was different a few thousand meters up. The simulated upper level winds would send any diatoms lifted by storms straight toward the Transantarctic Mountains.Put it all together and this seems to make a lot of sense. The \\u201cstabilists\\u201d can be right about the diatoms being blown up to the mountains, and the \\u201cdynamicists\\u201d can be right about the diatoms being linked to significant retreats of Antarctic ice. There isn\\u2019t always a \\u201cmiddle way\\u201d between two sides of a scientific argument, but there might be in this case.Apart from the pleasure of solving an interesting \\u201ccold case,\\\" this is actually important for our understanding of future sea level rise. We need all the clues we can get from Antarctica\\u2019s past to help us predict how it will respond as we turn up the planet\\u2019s thermostat.Open Access at Nature Communications, 2016.

In recent weeks he has found himself at the center of a debate over the influence money can have on journalism, and by extension, free speech. Thiel\\u00a0paid the lawyer who worked for Hulk Hogan in his suit against Gawker Media, eventually winning a massive judgement that led\\u00a0Gawker to declare bankruptcy. Thiel acknowledged the vendetta, which stems from a Gawker story published a decade earlier that outed him as gay, something Thiel wanted to keep private, or at least, out of the press.Thiel had been funding the lawsuit anonymously against Gawker Media. In fact, he paid the lawyer to\\u00a0litigate several cases, of which the Hogan case was simply the most successful. He has also made a name for himself as an advocate for an offshore libertarian state, a singularity university funder, and Donald Trump delegate.Like many other companies in Silicon Valley, Facebook has multiple classes of shares, only some of which are available to the public for purchase. That means that founder Mark Zuckerberg and other members of the board essentially\\u00a0have unilateral control on all votes, as their shares weigh far more heavily in the final tally. All that means is that, unless public outrage over Thiel's actions against Gawker grows far stronger, his seat on the board of the social network site is likely safe.\",\n          \"Bar carts save space and keep all your drink supplies handy, but can be expensive, if you find a good one.

Conversation toolsGo to permalinkRichard Branson at a mental health conference in April 2016 (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)“I hope in five years a reusable rocket will have been developed which can take up to 10 people at a time to stay at the Virgin Hotel for two weeks,” Richard Branson proudly announced back in 1999.AdvertisementWe’re still waiting on Branson’s Virgin Galactic to take tourists into space, despite the promises of the past two decades that he would do just that. But Branson has a new idea for the meantime: Why not launch small satellites into space? Called Virgin Orbit, Branson’s newest space venture will be led by former Boeing executive Dan Hart. “By offering low cost and frequent service to space, the team is revolutionizing the small satellite market within the promising space economy,” Branson bragged on his blog.AdvertisementBranson’s space strategy, however, is a little odd, so we’ve come up with a name for it: The Reverse Musk™. How do you pull off a Reverse Musk™? You start with the really hard stuff and then give up and try the more humble projects you should’ve been working on two decades ago.Elon Musk founded SpaceX in 2002 with bold dreams of eventually propelling humans into space—to Mars and beyond. But Musk realized that you had to start with the more modest stuff. Over the next decade, SpaceX built rockets and sent capsules to the International Space Station, and launched satellites.And all of those things paid off. Musk now talks about how he wants to send space tourists around the moon by the end of 2018. And even though it’s a tremendously ambitious goal, some people believe he can do it. Why? Musk started with the “smaller” stuff like launching satellites. Getting humans to the moon and Mars may have been the ultimate goal, but Musk clearly knew that you had to learn to walk before you could run.SponsoredBranson has always been about the opposite. Yes, he’s been developing his own rockets, and spaceships—one that tragically and infamously exploded in 2014, killing a pilot. But he only recently pursued private contracts to do the more modest stuff, like launching satellites into space, that ultimately teaches lessons that you can use for manned space travel. Branson did, however, get the state of New Mexico to pay $250 million for a spaceship graveyard. So it’s not like he wasn’t busy spending other people’s money. Just not in a way that benefited very many people.AdvertisementAdvertisement“It has been my longheld dream to open access to space to change the world for good,” Branson said in a statement about his new company. “We have been striving to do that by manufacturing vehicles of the future, enabling the small satellite revolution, and preparing commercial space flight for many more humans to reach space and see our home planet.”“I’m thrilled that our small satellite launch service has now progressed to the point it merits the formation of its own company, Virgin Orbit, and a new president in Dan  with decades of deep experience and success in a broad variety of space programs.”Will Virgin Orbit be successful? Hopefully. But it’s really something he should’ve started with back in the 2000s.Advertisement“Virgin Galactic officials said 100 people already have paid $200,000 apiece to fly into space,” a story from the Associated Press in 2005 promised. “They include actress Victoria Principal, who told the news conference she looked forward to being on the first civilian flight of Virgin Galactic, perhaps as soon as 2008.”Like we said, we’re still rooting for Branson’s The Reverse Musk™, even if he has almost 20 years of failed promises in his wake. Hopefully this one takes off. Do you get it? I said, I hope this one takes off. Like the spaceships. They take off.Recommended Stories15 Years of Virgin Galactic's Failed Space Age PromisesHere Is Richard Branson Dressed as a MermaidVirgin Galactic Is Finally Back in the SkyMatt Novaknovak@gizmodo.com@paleofutureMatt Novak is the editor of Gizmodo's Paleofuture blogPGP Fingerprint: 0074 467E 1339 F416 DA8C 6CFA 0ABD A808 C05C D4A6|PGP KeyReply1 repliesLeave a replyYou may also likeJezebelWhat Is \"Birth Rape\"?9/08/10 10:15amFoxtrot AlphaVeterans Outraged At How Trump Exploited A SEAL Widow's Grief For HimselfYesterday 7:11pmKotakuThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild: The Kotaku ReviewToday 6:00amRecent from Matt Novak2014426.7KPaleofuture · Matt NovakJeff Sessions, Anti-Weed Crusader, Was a Shill For Big TobaccoYesterday 9:45am85745.4KGizmodo · Matt NovakPhotoshop Contest: Oscars Fuck-up EditionMonday 8:50am2440337.9KGizmodo · Matt NovakCrowdfunding Is the Only Way Americans Know How to Mourn After Engineer Is Killed by Terrorist2/24/17 7:50amShareTweetAbout BlogNeed Help?Content GuideGizmodo StoreRedirecting to the Gizmodo store in  Disclaimer: You are leaving a Gizmodo Media Group, LLC website and going to a third party site, which is subject to its own privacy policy and terms of use.ContinuePermissionsPrivacyTerms of UseAdvertisingJobsRSS©2017 Gizmodo Media GroupKinja is in read-only mode.

seedsbagelsmuffinsdrugsdrug testsstudiesvideos6EditPromoteShare to KinjaToggle Conversation toolsGo to permalinkTales of poppy seed-covered foods being the cause of failed drug tests is a classic urban legend that’s been floating around since a certain episode of Seinfeld. While there may be some truth behind the myth, poppy seeds aren’t likely to ruin your drug test anymore.AdvertisementIn this video from the SciShow YouTube channel, Olivia Gordon explains the science of poppy seeds, opiates, and typical drug screening tests. If you weren’t aware, morphine and other opiates come from the same plant as poppy seeds: Papaver somniferum, or the opium poppy. So, it’s possible that poppy seeds—like you’d find on a bagel or in a muffin—carry the same chemical components as the opiates drug tests typically look for. However, the truth is the trace amounts of opiates that may have ended up on those poppy seeds don’t come anywhere close to the amount in an actual dose of morphine or other hard opiates. Urine tests are pretty sensitive, and those poppy seeds from your breakfast might show up, but it won’t be enough to raise a red flag. Furthermore, the threshold for opiates found in urine was raised back in the early 2000s from .3 micrograms per milliliter to 2 micrograms per milliliter, which is a massive gap. If you’re really worried about it, avoid consuming poppy seeds for a few days before your test. But don’t sweat it if you had a tasty poppy seed muffin that morning either.The Truths Behind Eight Common \"Old Wives' Tales\"The Truths Behind Eight Common \"Old Wives' Tales\"The Truths Behind Eight Common \"Old Wives' Tales\"Whether you heard them from friends or family, you've probably heard things that sound either…Read more Read moreCan Poppy Seeds Make You Fail a Drug Test? | YouTubePatrick Allanpatrick.allan@lifehacker.com@mr_patrickallanStaff Writer, Lifehacker.comReply6 repliesLeave a replyYou may also likeThe RootConn.

HomeComments 136SharesShareTweetShareSaveDevindra Hardawar/AOLAmazon's been expanding its line of smart, Alexa-powered home speakers for awhile now. If you're interested in buying an Amazon Echo, well then today is your lucky day. The smart speaker, which usually is priced at $180, is on sale for just $90 at select retailers today. You can also grab an Amazon Echo Dot for $35, a $15 discount off its regular price of $50, and an Amazon Tap for $80, discounted from the regular price of $130.It's strange that these devices would be on sale at third-party stores and not Amazon itself (not only is the Echo showing as full price, but it's out of stock, with an estimated ship date of August 11. However, you can pick up a discounted device at stores such as  Bed Bath & Beyond, Best Buy and Bloomingdale's. We've seen sales on the Echo before, but this seems to be the steepest discount yet. If you want to take advantage of this offer, make sure you grab one before midnight tonight, Central time.

There was the Smart Ultra 6, which was one of the best affordable phones of its time, and the Smart Platinum 7, which was an interesting step into more expensive, sub-flagship category. But alongside those, there have been a number of humdrum handsets that failed to impress. As per its yearly update cycle, Vodafone recently released new own-brand hardware, with the Smart V8 in particular slotting into the carrier's roster as one of the best affordable options.            Gallery: Vodafone Smart V8 | 16 Photos                       16                                +12                    The most immediately striking feature of the Smart V8 when you free it from its box is the build quality. It's almost entirely brushed metal aside from two pockets of textured plastic, with neatly chamfered edges and loudspeaker grilles. While it's not pushing the boundaries of design by any means, it certainly looks and feels like it's punching above the £159 pay-as-you-go price point.The spec sheet isn't to be taken lightly either. You're looking at a 5.5-inch, 1080p LCD display, an octa-core 1.4GHz Snapdragon 435, 3 gigs of RAM, 32GB of expandable storage, a 16-megapixel primary camera and 8MP front-facer, all powered by a decent-sized 3,000mAh battery. You also get a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor and NFC chip -- hello Android Pay. Perhaps even more important, the Smart V8 is running Android 7.1.1, so it's basically as up-to-date as you can get on the software front.It's more or less the stock Android experience, albeit with a few borderline-bloatware apps from Vodafone added in. One quirk I've discovered worth noting is I can't seem to resize widgets on the homescreen. Not a huge deal, but it does mean the digital clock widget is naturally off-centre, which is slightly irritating.In sunny summer conditions, the 16MP camera can be pretty handy. Good colour saturation, clarity, and contrast thanks to the HDR mode. The app is pretty busy with filters and features and settings, from full manual control to long exposure and \"active photo\" modes (kinda like GIFs/Live Photos). You won't find much help in them in low-light conditions, though, where the camera begins to fall off fairly quickly.             Gallery: Vodafone Smart V8 camera samples | 13 Photos                       13                                +9                    All in all, there's nothing particularly special about the Smart V8. These days, metalwork, this kind of spec sheet and value-added features like fingerprint sensor and NFC are becoming standard at the mid-to-low end. The new handset does have something going for it, though -- a pretty competitive price tag.Vodafone's pay-as-you-go range is relatively sparse around the £150 mark. You've got the £149 Sony Xperia L1, which is less attractive enough on paper to justify the jump to the £159 Smart V8. The closest handset beyond that point is the fairly comparable £199 Huawei P8 lite (2017). The Moto G5 gets a nod too, obviously, as well as the Wileyfox Swift 2, since they can be bought elsewhere for bang on £159. You wouldn't say either of them are significantly better than the Smart V8, though.Smart N8If you've set yourself a slightly tighter budget, Vodafone also recently launched the Smart N8, an £85 handset sitting in the crowded low-end of the pay-as-you-go spectrum. It's more than appropriately specced, with a 5-inch, 720p display, quad-core 1.3GHz MediaTek chip, 1.5GB of RAM, 16 gigs of expandable storage, 13- and 5-megapixel cameras, fingerprint sensor, NFC and 2,400mAh battery.Despite looking a little on the drab side, it's a decent value device. You could always save yourself a London pint and opt for the £79 Moto G4 Play instead, which recently began receiving Android Nougat, but you would be sacrificing the fingerprint reader/NFC combo. But that's true of most other devices dipping below the £100 marker at the moment.Smart Tab N8While the two smartphones have obvious places in Vodafone's backroom, the new Smart Tab N8 is where things get confusing. The draw of pretty much all own-brand tablets is ultimate portability, thanks to 4G, at a reasonable cost. I wouldn't call the Smart Tab N8 very portable though, because it's massive. It's not that heavy at 465g and it's pretty thin, too, with 8.95mm between the glass front and textured, tactile plastic back -- it's that it's all face.             Gallery: Vodafone Smart Tab N8 | 9 Photos                       9                                +5                    Not only does the slate carry a 10.1-inch display, but a significant bloating of bezel around it. It's not something you could slip into a handbag and it not be a nuisance, let's say. Worse yet, that 10.1-inch screen runs at a very noticeable 1,280 x 800 resolution, making it easy to pick out individual pixels. Large tablets are typically geared more towards entertainment, but 149 ppi doesn't really cut it nowadays.The other specs are largely irrelevant: A quad-core 1.1GHz MediaTek processor, 2 gigs of RAM, 16GB of expandable storage, 4,600mAh battery and 5MP/2MP cameras on the appropriate sides. Vodafone is selling the Smart Tab N8 on contracts starting at £16 per month for a 5GB data cap and no upfront payment. I'd sooner get exactly the same plan with Samsung's 10.1-inch Galaxy Tab A (2016), since it's been upgraded to Nougat already and waves a more alluring spec sheet, the 1,920 x 1,200 display being the most important upgrade. Hits and misses for Vodafone again, it would appear.

Apple VP of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives Lisa Jackson knows this perfectly well as she’s responsible for making sure that Apple doesn’t make any compromise in favor of unrestrained growth. That’s why we’re excited to talk with Lisa Jackson on stage at Disrupt SF 2017 about the other side of tech.Jackson’s role at Apple encompasses so many different things. She’s the one responsible for minimizing Apple’s impact on the environment. Apple is building data centers that run 100 percent on renewable energy. But it is also concerned about the impact of its retail stores and offices.Apple also sells tens of millions of devices every quarter. The company needs to make sure that it comes in tiny packages so that it uses fewer planes, boats and trucks. And those packages are made out of paper. The company is trying to protect forests used in the production of paper packaging for Apple items.The company doesn’t want to mine the Earth until there’s no resources left. Apple is trying to use recycled material as much as possible in order to protect the Earth. And of course, Apple is trying to get back and recycle as many broken or unused devices at the end of their life cycle as possible.Apple is not perfect and it definitely feels like a work in progress, but Apple is also communicating a lot on those issues and regularly sharing updates about their various environmental projects.And protecting the Earth is just one aspect. Jackson is also trying to protect human rights and looking at Apple’s social impact. That’s why Apple stopped relying on cobalt from Congo after learning about child labor. The company is working with so many different suppliers that it needs to implement strong processes to find out if everyone is paid fairly under acceptable working conditions.Social issues aren’t limited to factories overseas. Tech companies have a responsibility when it comes to hiring and promoting a diverse pool of talent. That’s why Apple appointed its first-ever VP of Diversity and Inclusion Denise Young Smith earlier this year.And finally, Apple and other tech companies have become so big that they have a responsibility when it comes to policy changes. Everybody remembers the San Bernardino encryption case — Apple took a strong stance against the FBI and in favor of privacy.Under President Donald Trump’s administration, Silicon Valley leaders often strongly disagree with some of his decisions or tweets. It’s going to be interesting to discuss how Silicon Valley can have a say in those decisions.If you want to hear our discussion with Lisa Jackson, grab an early-bird ticket to Disrupt. You’ll also hear from Anna Fang (Zhen Fund), Adi Tatarko (Houzz), Kevin Durant (Golden State Warriors), Sebastian Thrun (Udacity) or dozens of other terrific speakers.0SHARESAdvertisementAdvertisement Newsletter SubscriptionsThe Daily CrunchGet the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inboxTC Weekly RoundupGet a weekly recap of the biggest tech storiesCrunchbase DailyThe latest startup funding announcementsEnter AddressSubscribeSEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report Jeff Bezos Becomes World's Richest Person | Crunch ReportWatch More EpisodesDisrupt SF 2017disrupt sfDisruptAppleLisa JacksonPopular Posts Featured Stories Amazon launches ‘The Hub’, parcel delivery lockers for apartment buildings17 hours ago | Ingrid Lunden It looks like Amazon would be losing a lot of money if not for AWS19 hours ago | Matthew Lynley Jeff Bezos’ brief stint as world’s richest human ends with Amazon’s second-quarter whiff20 hours ago | Matthew Lynley Apple discontinues iPod nano and shuffle and doubles iPod touch capacities to 32GB and 128GByesterday | Brian HeaterLatest From TechCrunch CocuSocial is a marketplace for affordable cooking classes13 minutes ago | Fitz Tepper Twitter tests a $99 monthly automatic Tweet promotion service26 minutes ago | Darrell Etherington Amazon gets into shoes and handbags with its new private fashion label ‘The Fix’38 minutes ago | Sarah Perez A race is underway to repair our hearing — with medicine1 hour ago | Connie Loizos Comment moderation powered by  Up NextA race is underway to repair our hearing — with medicinePosted 1 hour ago  CrunchBoardJob ListingsSoftware Engineer - Java (Contract) at Motorola Solutions (Seattle, WA, United States)Senior Android and IOS Developer (Contract) at Motorola Solutions (Seattle, WA, United States)Sr Software Engineer (Back End) at Etleap (San Francisco, CA, United States)Data Engineer at Etleap (San Francisco, CA, United States)Full Stack Developer at Laborocity (Radnor, PA, United States)More from CrunchBoardAdvertisementTechCrunchNewsVideoEventsCrunchbaseTechCrunch StoreAboutStaffContact UsAdvertise With UsEvent & Editorial CalendarSend Us A TipActivations BlogInternationalChinaEuropeJapanFollow TechCrunchFacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInYoutubePinterestTumblrInstagramStumbleUponFeedTechCrunch AppsiOSAndroidWindows 8Subscribe to The Daily CrunchLatest headlines delivered to you dailySubscribe to <span class=\"no-mobile\">Subscribe to </span>The Daily CrunchEnter Email AddressSubscribe © 2013-2017 Oath Inc.

Named for computer science pioneer Alan Turing, the award is widely regarded as the highest distinction in Computer Science.Hellman and then-Stanford researcher Whitfield Diffie won the award for their fundamental contributions to modern cryptography. The two introduced the ideas of public-key cryptography and digital signatures, which laid the basis for most security protocols used on the Internet today.The two are integral contributors to the debate on computer and Internet privacy, and were at the forefront of what are now referred to as the first “crypto wars.” The two fought the NSA and other government agencies for the right to publish and disseminate their work to the broader public, instead of the small community of government users who wanted to keep encryption a closely guarded secret.We spoke to Professor Hellman at his home on Stanford University’s campus, discussing the work that led to the award, his fight for computer privacy and the current legal feud between Apple Computer and the Federal Bureau of Investigation over backdoors into the iOS mobile operating system.0SHARESAdvertisementAdvertisement CrunchBaseStanford University Founded1885OverviewStanford University makes a great fit for the academically driven\\rstudent.

Saturday, April 30, 2016.Image:  AP Photo/Susan WalshBy Brittany Levine Beckman2016-05-01 05:19:20 UTCTired of Senate Republicans refusing to approve his Supreme Court nominee, President Barack Obama may be compelled to take extreme measures. Westeros-style.At his final White House Correspondents' Dinner Saturday, Obama, a Game of Thrones fan, noted there were quite a few Republican senators seated in the cavernous Washington Hilton ballroom during his speech, making it the perfect time to officially fill the late Justice Antonin Scalia's seat with his pick, Judge Merrick Garland.SEE ALSO: Obama can't wait to wear mom jeans after he leaves the White House\"They're in the house, which reminds me, security, bar the doors. Judge Merrick Garland come on out. We're going to do this right here, right now,\" Obama said. \"It's like the Red Wedding.\"WATCH: @POTUS tries to get Merrick Garland confirmed at the #WHCD: \"It's like the Red Wedding.\" https://t.co/McDTrBWMc6— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) May 1, 2016Obama (in)famously received an early look at Game of Thrones' sixth season, making the rest of us show lovers, and especially Jon Snow fans, feel like the peasants of King's Landing. As Game of Thrones watchers know, Jon Snow's half-brother, Robb Stark, his wife, mother and his army were slaughtered after being barricaded in a room following his uncle's nuptials, hence the devastating Red Wedding.Of course, Obama didn't want to take it that far at an event jokingly known as the nerd prom. He was just referring to the \"lock them in\" part. Right? Have something to add to this story?

By  Jo Rhett April 25, 2016Departure board at night                            (source: James Creegan via Flickr).                      This is an excerpt from Learning Puppet 4, by Jo Rhett. It may contain references to unavailable content that is part of the larger resource.The following are good practices that you should employ to take care of your Puppet servers.Indenting HeredocHeredoc format can suppress leading spaces, allowing you to maintain indentation in the code without this showing up to the user:   else {     if( $keeping_up_with_jones ) {       $message_text = @(END)         This is a bit of a rat race, don't you think $username?         All this running about, for $effort and $gain,         the results of which we can't see at all.         |- END     }   }Furthermore, you can tell Heredoc the syntax inside the block and it can validate the syntax for you. Geppetto will display it according to the appropriate syntax scheme:$certificates = @(END:json)   {     \"private_key\": \"-----RSA PRIVATE KEY----...\",     \"public_key\": \"-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----...\",     \"certificate\": \"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----...\"   }   | ENDSplaying Puppet Agent Cron JobsIf you run Puppet from cron and use Puppet or any shared data sources, you can't run them all at the same time or you will overload the data source. In situations with only a few hundred nodes, you can simply use the splay feature and the random distribution will be random enough:cron { 'puppet-agent':  ensure      => present,  environment => 'PATH=/usr/bin:/opt/puppetlabs/bin'  command     => 'puppet agent --onetime --no-daemonize --splay --splaylimit 30m\",  user        => 'root',  minute      => 0,}In my experience, after a few hundred nodes you'll find that a quarter of them end up in the same three minutes and you'll experience the \"thundering herd\" phenomenon. At that point, you'll want a mechanism to guarantee a more consistent spread of hosts.The way to do this is to have the server calculate a different minute number for each node, and add the cron resource to its catalog with that minute. The number selection must be consistent, as random numbers will change on each connection.The easiest way with zero development on your part is to use the fqdn_rand(minutes,string) function, which will always produce the same value between 0 and the minutes provided. If you don't provide a string, it will use the current node name as salt. It is possible to supply any value (which doesn't change on a node) as salt. Here are some of my favorite sources for the string:Any unique identifier for each node, such as a serial number.The node's IP address. The unique fe80:: address is always good.Node certificate name or fully qualified domain name.A unique identifier for each node from an internal datastore.It really doesn't matter how you generate the source number for the node, so long as it is evenly distributed and does not change often. However you generate the number, add 30 for the second run. Place both of these numbers in a resource like so:$minute = fqdn_rand( 30, $facts['certname'] )cron { 'puppet-agent':  ensure  => present,  command => '/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet agent --onetime --no-daemonize',  user    => 'root',  minute  => [ $minute, $minute+30 ]}Cleaning Puppet ReportsThe reports created by Puppet nodes are never removed by the server. You'll have to add jobs to clean them up. Shown here is a resource for your server to clean up reports after 90 days:cron { 'clean-puppetserver-reports':  command => 'find /var/opt/puppetlabs/puppetserver/reports -ctime +90 -delete',  user    => 'root',  minute  => '2',  hour    => '3',}While it's not likely to fill up quite so fast, the same problem does exist for the node itself. Here's a resource to apply to every node to clean up the reports once a month:cron { 'clean-puppet-agent-reports':  command => 'find /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/cache/reports -ctime +90 -delete',  user    => 'root',  day     => '1',  minute  => '2',  hour    => '3',}Adjust the timing of the runs and the retention length to meet your own needs. In many environments we centrally archive the reports on long-term storage, and delete reports older than two days on the node every night.

This?Jon Bernthal as Frank Castle, A.K.A. the Punisher, in 'Daredevil' Season 2Image:  netflixBy Proma Khosla2016-04-29 13:57:51 UTCHell's Kitchen continues to burn. With success of Daredevil, the critical acclaim of Jessica Jones, and mounting excitement for Luke Cage and Iron Fist — all leading up to a Defenders miniseries — Marvel is adding another name to its slate of Netflix properties.SEE ALSO: 'Daredevil' Season 2 is crowded, which just means there's more to loveThe new series will focus on The Punisher, and will star Jon Bernthal in the title role — reprising a part he first played on Daredevil Season 2. Hannibal's Steve Lightfoot will serve as showrunner. News of the show was first reported by Entertainment Weekly and confirmed by Netflix on Friday. The Punisher was first introduced in Frank Miller's Daredevil comics as a vengeful and violent vigilante – a darker shade of Daredevil and a warning of what Matt Murdock could become if he veered off his chosen path. Castle is disillusioned by war and fueled by hatred, determined to avenge the deaths of his family and any other casualties of bigger battle.The Punisher series doesn't yet have a premiere date.Have something to add to this story?

being the cause of failed drug tests is a classic urban legend that’s been floating around since a certain episode of Seinfeld. While there may be some truth behind the myth, poppy seeds aren’t likely to ruin your drug test anymore.In this video from the SciShow YouTube channel, Olivia Gordon explains the science of poppy seeds, opiates, and typical drug screening tests. If you weren’t aware, morphine and other opiates come from the same plant as poppy seeds: Papaver somniferum, or the opium poppy. So, it’s possible that poppy seeds—like you’d find on a bagel or in a muffin—carry the same chemical components as the opiates drug tests typically look for. However, the truth is the trace amounts of opiates that may have ended up on those poppy seeds don’t come anywhere close to the amount in an actual dose of morphine or other hard opiates. Urine tests are pretty sensitive, and those poppy seeds from your breakfast might show up, but it won’t be enough to raise a red flag. Furthermore, the threshold for opiates found in urine was raised back in the early 2000s from .3 micrograms per milliliter to 2 micrograms per milliliter, which is a massive gap. If you’re really worried about it, avoid consuming poppy seeds for a few days before your test. But don’t sweat it if you had a tasty poppy seed muffin that morning either.Can Poppy Seeds Make You Fail a Drug Test? | YouTube   \n","2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Amazon's been expanding its line of smart, Alexa-powered home speakers for awhile now. If you're interested in buying an Amazon Echo, well then today is your lucky day. The smart speaker, which usually is priced at $180, is on sale for just $90 at select retailers today. You can also grab an Amazon Echo Dot for $35, a $15 discount off its regular price of $50, and an Amazon Tap for $80, discounted from the regular price of $130.It's strange that these devices would be on sale at third-party stores and not Amazon itself (not only is the Echo showing as full price, but it's out of stock, with an estimated ship date of August 11. However, you can pick up a discounted device at stores such as  Bed Bath & Beyond, Best Buy and Bloomingdale's. We've seen sales on the Echo before, but this seems to be the steepest discount yet. If you want to take advantage of this offer, make sure you grab one before midnight tonight, Central time.Source: The Verge   \n","3      Vodafone's own-brand devices have been hit and miss over the past few years. There was the Smart Ultra 6, which was one of the best affordable phones of its time, and the Smart Platinum 7, which was an interesting step into more expensive, sub-flagship category. But alongside those, there have been a number of humdrum handsets that failed to impress. As per its yearly update cycle, Vodafone recently released new own-brand hardware, with the Smart V8 in particular slotting into the carrier's roster as one of the best affordable options.The most immediately striking feature of the Smart V8 when you free it from its box is the build quality. It's almost entirely brushed metal aside from two pockets of textured plastic, with neatly chamfered edges and loudspeaker grilles. While it's not pushing the boundaries of design by any means, it certainly looks and feels like it's punching above the £159 pay-as-you-go price point.The spec sheet isn't to be taken lightly either. You're looking at a 5.5-inch, 1080p LCD display, an octa-core 1.4GHz Snapdragon 435, 3 gigs of RAM, 32GB of expandable storage, a 16-megapixel primary camera and 8MP front-facer, all powered by a decent-sized 3,000mAh battery. You also get a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor and NFC chip -- hello Android Pay. Perhaps even more important, the Smart V8 is running Android 7.1.1, so it's basically as up-to-date as you can get on the software front.It's more or less the stock Android experience, albeit with a few borderline-bloatware apps from Vodafone added in. One quirk I've discovered worth noting is I can't seem to resize widgets on the homescreen. Not a huge deal, but it does mean the digital clock widget is naturally off-centre, which is slightly irritating.In sunny summer conditions, the 16MP camera can be pretty handy. Good colour saturation, clarity, and contrast thanks to the HDR mode. The app is pretty busy with filters and features and settings, from full manual control to long exposure and \"active photo\" modes (kinda like GIFs/Live Photos). You won't find much help in them in low-light conditions, though, where the camera begins to fall off fairly quickly. All in all, there's nothing particularly special about the Smart V8. These days, metalwork, this kind of spec sheet and value-added features like fingerprint sensor and NFC are becoming standard at the mid-to-low end. The new handset does have something going for it, though -- a pretty competitive price tag.Vodafone's pay-as-you-go range is relatively sparse around the £150 mark. You've got the £149 Sony Xperia L1, which is less attractive enough on paper to justify the jump to the £159 Smart V8. The closest handset beyond that point is the fairly comparable £199 Huawei P8 lite (2017). The Moto G5 gets a nod too, obviously, as well as the Wileyfox Swift 2, since they can be bought elsewhere for bang on £159. You wouldn't say either of them are significantly better than the Smart V8, though.Smart N8If you've set yourself a slightly tighter budget, Vodafone also recently launched the Smart N8, an £85 handset sitting in the crowded low-end of the pay-as-you-go spectrum. It's more than appropriately specced, with a 5-inch, 720p display, quad-core 1.3GHz MediaTek chip, 1.5GB of RAM, 16 gigs of expandable storage, 13- and 5-megapixel cameras, fingerprint sensor, NFC and 2,400mAh battery.Despite looking a little on the drab side, it's a decent value device. You could always save yourself a London pint and opt for the £79 Moto G4 Play instead, which recently began receiving Android Nougat, but you would be sacrificing the fingerprint reader/NFC combo. But that's true of most other devices dipping below the £100 marker at the moment.Smart Tab N8While the two smartphones have obvious places in Vodafone's backroom, the new Smart Tab N8 is where things get confusing. The draw of pretty much all own-brand tablets is ultimate portability, thanks to 4G, at a reasonable cost. I wouldn't call the Smart Tab N8 very portable though, because it's massive. It's not that heavy at 465g and it's pretty thin, too, with 8.95mm between the glass front and textured, tactile plastic back -- it's that it's all face. Not only does the slate carry a 10.1-inch display, but a significant bloating of bezel around it. It's not something you could slip into a handbag and it not be a nuisance, let's say. Worse yet, that 10.1-inch screen runs at a very noticeable 1,280 x 800 resolution, making it easy to pick out individual pixels. Large tablets are typically geared more towards entertainment, but 149 ppi doesn't really cut it nowadays.The other specs are largely irrelevant: A quad-core 1.1GHz MediaTek processor, 2 gigs of RAM, 16GB of expandable storage, 4,600mAh battery and 5MP/2MP cameras on the appropriate sides. Vodafone is selling the Smart Tab N8 on contracts starting at £16 per month for a 5GB data cap and no upfront payment. I'd sooner get exactly the same plan with Samsung's 10.1-inch Galaxy Tab A (2016), since it's been upgraded to Nougat already and waves a more alluring spec sheet, the 1,920 x 1,200 display being the most important upgrade. Hits and misses for Vodafone again, it would appear.   \n","4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The tech industry has become so big that it now plays a much bigger role than just enabling productivity and fostering economic growth.

to permalinkRichard Branson at a mental health conference in April 2016 (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)“I hope in five years a reusable rocket will have been developed which can take up to 10 people at a time to stay at the Virgin Hotel for two weeks,” Richard Branson proudly announced back in 1999.AdvertisementWe’re still waiting on Branson’s Virgin Galactic to take tourists into space, despite the promises of the past two decades that he would do just that. But Branson has a new idea for the meantime: Why not launch small satellites into space? Called Virgin Orbit, Branson’s newest space venture will be led by former Boeing executive Dan Hart. “By offering low cost and frequent service to space, the team is revolutionizing the small satellite market within the promising space economy,” Branson bragged on his blog.AdvertisementBranson’s space strategy, however, is a little odd, so we’ve come up with a name for it: The Reverse Musk™. How do you pull off a Reverse Musk™? You start with the really hard stuff and then give up and try the more humble projects you should’ve been working on two decades ago.Elon Musk founded SpaceX in 2002 with bold dreams of eventually propelling humans into space—to Mars and beyond. But Musk realized that you had to start with the more modest stuff. Over the next decade, SpaceX built rockets and sent capsules to the International Space Station, and launched satellites.And all of those things paid off. Musk now talks about how he wants to send space tourists around the moon by the end of 2018. And even though it’s a tremendously ambitious goal, some people believe he can do it. Why? Musk started with the “smaller” stuff like launching satellites. Getting humans to the moon and Mars may have been the ultimate goal, but Musk clearly knew that you had to learn to walk before you could run.SponsoredBranson has always been about the opposite. Yes, he’s been developing his own rockets, and spaceships—one that tragically and infamously exploded in 2014, killing a pilot. But he only recently pursued private contracts to do the more modest stuff, like launching satellites into space, that ultimately teaches lessons that you can use for manned space travel. Branson did, however, get the state of New Mexico to pay $250 million for a spaceship graveyard. So it’s not like he wasn’t busy spending other people’s money. Just not in a way that benefited very many people.AdvertisementAdvertisement“It has been my longheld dream to open access to space to change the world for good,” Branson said in a statement about his new company. “We have been striving to do that by manufacturing vehicles of the future, enabling the small satellite revolution, and preparing commercial space flight for many more humans to reach space and see our home planet.”“I’m thrilled that our small satellite launch service has now progressed to the point it merits the formation of its own company, Virgin Orbit, and a new president in Dan  with decades of deep experience and success in a broad variety of space programs.”Will Virgin Orbit be successful? Hopefully. But it’s really something he should’ve started with back in the 2000s.Advertisement“Virgin Galactic officials said 100 people already have paid $200,000 apiece to fly into space,” a story from the Associated Press in 2005 promised. “They include actress Victoria Principal, who told the news conference she looked forward to being on the first civilian flight of Virgin Galactic, perhaps as soon as 2008.”Like we said, we’re still rooting for Branson’s The Reverse Musk™, even if he has almost 20 years of failed promises in his wake. Hopefully this one takes off. Do you get it? I said, I hope this one takes off. Like the spaceships. They take off.Recommended Stories15 Years of Virgin Galactic's Failed Space Age PromisesHere Is Richard Branson Dressed as a MermaidVirgin Galactic Is Finally Back in the SkyMatt Novaknovak@gizmodo.com@paleofutureMatt Novak is the editor of Gizmodo's Paleofuture blogPGP Fingerprint: 0074 467E 1339 F416 DA8C 6CFA 0ABD A808 C05C D4A6|PGP KeyReply1 repliesLeave a replyYou may also likeJezebelWhat Is \"Birth Rape\"?9/08/10 10:15amFoxtrot AlphaVeterans Outraged At How Trump Exploited A SEAL Widow's Grief For HimselfYesterday 7:11pmKotakuThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild: The Kotaku ReviewToday 6:00amRecent from Matt Novak2014426.7KPaleofuture · Matt NovakJeff Sessions, Anti-Weed Crusader, Was a Shill For Big TobaccoYesterday 9:45am85745.4KGizmodo · Matt NovakPhotoshop Contest: Oscars Fuck-up EditionMonday 8:50am2440337.9KGizmodo · Matt NovakCrowdfunding Is the Only Way Americans Know How to Mourn After Engineer Is Killed by Terrorist2/24/17 7:50amShareTweetAbout BlogNeed Help?Content GuideGizmodo StoreRedirecting to the Gizmodo store in  Disclaimer: You are leaving a Gizmodo Media Group, LLC website and going to a third party site, which is subject to its own privacy policy and terms of use.ContinuePermissionsPrivacyTerms of UseAdvertisingJobsRSS©2017 Gizmodo Media GroupKinja is in read-only mode.

While there may be some truth behind the myth, poppy seeds aren’t likely to ruin your drug test anymore.AdvertisementIn this video from the SciShow YouTube channel, Olivia Gordon explains the science of poppy seeds, opiates, and typical drug screening tests. If you weren’t aware, morphine and other opiates come from the same plant as poppy seeds: Papaver somniferum, or the opium poppy. So, it’s possible that poppy seeds—like you’d find on a bagel or in a muffin—carry the same chemical components as the opiates drug tests typically look for. However, the truth is the trace amounts of opiates that may have ended up on those poppy seeds don’t come anywhere close to the amount in an actual dose of morphine or other hard opiates. Urine tests are pretty sensitive, and those poppy seeds from your breakfast might show up, but it won’t be enough to raise a red flag.

While there may be some truth behind the myth, poppy seeds aren’t likely to ruin your drug test anymore.In this video from the SciShow YouTube channel, Olivia Gordon explains the science of poppy seeds, opiates, and typical drug screening tests. If you weren’t aware, morphine and other opiates come from the same plant as poppy seeds: Papaver somniferum, or the opium poppy. So, it’s possible that poppy seeds—like you’d find on a bagel or in a muffin—carry the same chemical components as the opiates drug tests typically look for. However, the truth is the trace amounts of opiates that may have ended up on those poppy seeds don’t come anywhere close to the amount in an actual dose of morphine or other hard opiates. Urine tests are pretty sensitive, and those poppy seeds from your breakfast might show up, but it won’t be enough to raise a red flag. Furthermore, the threshold for opiates found in urine was raised back in the early 2000s from .3 micrograms per milliliter to 2 micrograms per milliliter, which is a massive gap. If you’re really worried about it, avoid consuming poppy seeds for a few days before your test.

There was the Smart Ultra 6, which was one of the best affordable phones of its time, and the Smart Platinum 7, which was an interesting step into more expensive, sub-flagship category. But alongside those, there have been a number of humdrum handsets that failed to impress. As per its yearly update cycle, Vodafone recently released new own-brand hardware, with the Smart V8 in particular slotting into the carrier's roster as one of the best affordable options.            Gallery: Vodafone Smart V8 | 16 Photos                       16                                +12                    The most immediately striking feature of the Smart V8 when you free it from its box is the build quality. It's almost entirely brushed metal aside from two pockets of textured plastic, with neatly chamfered edges and loudspeaker grilles. While it's not pushing the boundaries of design by any means, it certainly looks and feels like it's punching above the £159 pay-as-you-go price point.The spec sheet isn't to be taken lightly either. You're looking at a 5.5-inch, 1080p LCD display, an octa-core 1.4GHz Snapdragon 435, 3 gigs of RAM, 32GB of expandable storage, a 16-megapixel primary camera and 8MP front-facer, all powered by a decent-sized 3,000mAh battery. You also get a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor and NFC chip -- hello Android Pay. Perhaps even more important, the Smart V8 is running Android 7.1.1, so it's basically as up-to-date as you can get on the software front.It's more or less the stock Android experience, albeit with a few borderline-bloatware apps from Vodafone added in. One quirk I've discovered worth noting is I can't seem to resize widgets on the homescreen. Not a huge deal, but it does mean the digital clock widget is naturally off-centre, which is slightly irritating.In sunny summer conditions, the 16MP camera can be pretty handy. Good colour saturation, clarity, and contrast thanks to the HDR mode. The app is pretty busy with filters and features and settings, from full manual control to long exposure and \"active photo\" modes (kinda like GIFs/Live Photos). You won't find much help in them in low-light conditions, though, where the camera begins to fall off fairly quickly.             Gallery: Vodafone Smart V8 camera samples | 13 Photos                       13                                +9                    All in all, there's nothing particularly special about the Smart V8. These days, metalwork, this kind of spec sheet and value-added features like fingerprint sensor and NFC are becoming standard at the mid-to-low end. The new handset does have something going for it, though -- a pretty competitive price tag.Vodafone's pay-as-you-go range is relatively sparse around the £150 mark. You've got the £149 Sony Xperia L1, which is less attractive enough on paper to justify the jump to the £159 Smart V8. The closest handset beyond that point is the fairly comparable £199 Huawei P8 lite (2017). The Moto G5 gets a nod too, obviously, as well as the Wileyfox Swift 2, since they can be bought elsewhere for bang on £159. You wouldn't say either of them are significantly better than the Smart V8, though.Smart N8If you've set yourself a slightly tighter budget, Vodafone also recently launched the Smart N8, an £85 handset sitting in the crowded low-end of the pay-as-you-go spectrum. It's more than appropriately specced, with a 5-inch, 720p display, quad-core 1.3GHz MediaTek chip, 1.5GB of RAM, 16 gigs of expandable storage, 13- and 5-megapixel cameras, fingerprint sensor, NFC and 2,400mAh battery.Despite looking a little on the drab side, it's a decent value device. You could always save yourself a London pint and opt for the £79 Moto G4 Play instead, which recently began receiving Android Nougat, but you would be sacrificing the fingerprint reader/NFC combo. But that's true of most other devices dipping below the £100 marker at the moment.Smart Tab N8While the two smartphones have obvious places in Vodafone's backroom, the new Smart Tab N8 is where things get confusing. The draw of pretty much all own-brand tablets is ultimate portability, thanks to 4G, at a reasonable cost. I wouldn't call the Smart Tab N8 very portable though, because it's massive. It's not that heavy at 465g and it's pretty thin, too, with 8.95mm between the glass front and textured, tactile plastic back -- it's that it's all face.             Gallery: Vodafone Smart Tab N8 | 9 Photos                       9                                +5                    Not only does the slate carry a 10.1-inch display, but a significant bloating of bezel around it. It's not something you could slip into a handbag and it not be a nuisance, let's say. Worse yet, that 10.1-inch screen runs at a very noticeable 1,280 x 800 resolution, making it easy to pick out individual pixels. Large tablets are typically geared more towards entertainment, but 149 ppi doesn't really cut it nowadays.The other specs are largely irrelevant: A quad-core 1.1GHz MediaTek processor, 2 gigs of RAM, 16GB of expandable storage, 4,600mAh battery and 5MP/2MP cameras on the appropriate sides. Vodafone is selling the Smart Tab N8 on contracts starting at £16 per month for a 5GB data cap and no upfront payment. I'd sooner get exactly the same plan with Samsung's 10.1-inch Galaxy Tab A (2016), since it's been upgraded to Nougat already and waves a more alluring spec sheet, the 1,920 x 1,200 display being the most important upgrade. Hits and misses for Vodafone again, it would appear.

You won't find much help in them in low-light conditions, though, where the camera begins to fall off fairly quickly. All in all, there's nothing particularly special about the Smart V8. These days, metalwork, this kind of spec sheet and value-added features like fingerprint sensor and NFC are becoming standard at the mid-to-low end. The new handset does have something going for it, though -- a pretty competitive price tag.Vodafone's pay-as-you-go range is relatively sparse around the £150 mark. You've got the £149 Sony Xperia L1, which is less attractive enough on paper to justify the jump to the £159 Smart V8. The closest handset beyond that point is the fairly comparable £199 Huawei P8 lite (2017). The Moto G5 gets a nod too, obviously, as well as the Wileyfox Swift 2, since they can be bought elsewhere for bang on £159. You wouldn't say either of them are significantly better than the Smart V8, though.Smart N8If you've set yourself a slightly tighter budget, Vodafone also recently launched the Smart N8, an £85 handset sitting in the crowded low-end of the pay-as-you-go spectrum. It's more than appropriately specced, with a 5-inch, 720p display, quad-core 1.3GHz MediaTek chip, 1.5GB of RAM, 16 gigs of expandable storage, 13- and 5-megapixel cameras, fingerprint sensor, NFC and 2,400mAh battery.Despite looking a little on the drab side, it's a decent value device. You could always save yourself a London pint and opt for the £79 Moto G4 Play instead, which recently began receiving Android Nougat, but you would be sacrificing the fingerprint reader/NFC combo. But that's true of most other devices dipping below the £100 marker at the moment.Smart Tab N8While the two smartphones have obvious places in Vodafone's backroom, the new Smart Tab N8 is where things get confusing. The draw of pretty much all own-brand tablets is ultimate portability, thanks to 4G, at a reasonable cost. I wouldn't call the Smart Tab N8 very portable though, because it's massive. It's not that heavy at 465g and it's pretty thin, too, with 8.95mm between the glass front and textured, tactile plastic back -- it's that it's all face. Not only does the slate carry a 10.1-inch display, but a significant bloating of bezel around it. It's not something you could slip into a handbag and it not be a nuisance, let's say. Worse yet, that 10.1-inch screen runs at a very noticeable 1,280 x 800 resolution, making it easy to pick out individual pixels. Large tablets are typically geared more towards entertainment, but 149 ppi doesn't really cut it nowadays.The other specs are largely irrelevant: A quad-core 1.1GHz MediaTek processor, 2 gigs of RAM, 16GB of expandable storage, 4,600mAh battery and 5MP/2MP cameras on the appropriate sides. Vodafone is selling the Smart Tab N8 on contracts starting at £16 per month for a 5GB data cap and no upfront payment. I'd sooner get exactly the same plan with Samsung's 10.1-inch Galaxy Tab A (2016), since it's been upgraded to Nougat already and waves a more alluring spec sheet, the 1,920 x 1,200 display being the most important upgrade. Hits and misses for Vodafone again, it would appear.</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>[['Jamie Rigg']]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>597b6adedf23b703bdc26cad</td>\n","      <td>56d609d1c180811310e52beb</td>\n","      <td>Apple’s Lisa Jackson to talk about the environmental and social role of tech companies at Disrupt SF</td>\n","      <td>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/18dL7NDCjvA/</td>\n","      <td>2017-07-28 15:47:41</td>\n","      <td>Apple’s Lisa Jackson to talk about the environmental and social role of tech companies at Disrupt SF  |  TechCrunch MenuSearchFollow UsFacebookInstagramTwitterYoutubeFlipboardLinkedInGoogle+RSSMoreYoutubeFlipboardLinkedInGoogle+RSSGot a tip?

Apple VP of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives Lisa Jackson knows this perfectly well as she’s responsible for making sure that Apple doesn’t make any compromise in favor of unrestrained growth. That’s why we’re excited to talk with Lisa Jackson on stage at Disrupt SF 2017 about the other side of tech.Jackson’s role at Apple encompasses so many different things. She’s the one responsible for minimizing Apple’s impact on the environment. Apple is building data centers that run 100 percent on renewable energy. But it is also concerned about the impact of its retail stores and offices.Apple also sells tens of millions of devices every quarter. The company needs to make sure that it comes in tiny packages so that it uses fewer planes, boats and trucks. And those packages are made out of paper. The company is trying to protect forests used in the production of paper packaging for Apple items.The company doesn’t want to mine the Earth until there’s no resources left. Apple is trying to use recycled material as much as possible in order to protect the Earth. And of course, Apple is trying to get back and recycle as many broken or unused devices at the end of their life cycle as possible.Apple is not perfect and it definitely feels like a work in progress, but Apple is also communicating a lot on those issues and regularly sharing updates about their various environmental projects.And protecting the Earth is just one aspect. Jackson is also trying to protect human rights and looking at Apple’s social impact. That’s why Apple stopped relying on cobalt from Congo after learning about child labor. The company is working with so many different suppliers that it needs to implement strong processes to find out if everyone is paid fairly under acceptable working conditions.Social issues aren’t limited to factories overseas. Tech companies have a responsibility when it comes to hiring and promoting a diverse pool of talent. That’s why Apple appointed its first-ever VP of Diversity and Inclusion Denise Young Smith earlier this year.And finally, Apple and other tech companies have become so big that they have a responsibility when it comes to policy changes. Everybody remembers the San Bernardino encryption case — Apple took a strong stance against the FBI and in favor of privacy.Under President Donald Trump’s administration, Silicon Valley leaders often strongly disagree with some of his decisions or tweets. It’s going to be interesting to discuss how Silicon Valley can have a say in those decisions.If you want to hear our discussion with Lisa Jackson, grab an early-bird ticket to Disrupt. You’ll also hear from Anna Fang (Zhen Fund), Adi Tatarko (Houzz), Kevin Durant (Golden State Warriors), Sebastian Thrun (Udacity) or dozens of other terrific speakers.0SHARESAdvertisementAdvertisement Newsletter SubscriptionsThe Daily CrunchGet the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inboxTC Weekly RoundupGet a weekly recap of the biggest tech storiesCrunchbase DailyThe latest startup funding announcementsEnter AddressSubscribeSEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report Jeff Bezos Becomes World's Richest Person | Crunch ReportWatch More EpisodesDisrupt SF 2017disrupt sfDisruptAppleLisa JacksonPopular Posts Featured Stories Amazon launches ‘The Hub’, parcel delivery lockers for apartment buildings17 hours ago | Ingrid Lunden It looks like Amazon would be losing a lot of money if not for AWS19 hours ago | Matthew Lynley Jeff Bezos’ brief stint as world’s richest human ends with Amazon’s second-quarter whiff20 hours ago | Matthew Lynley Apple discontinues iPod nano and shuffle and doubles iPod touch capacities to 32GB and 128GByesterday | Brian HeaterLatest From TechCrunch CocuSocial is a marketplace for affordable cooking classes13 minutes ago | Fitz Tepper Twitter tests a $99 monthly automatic Tweet promotion service26 minutes ago | Darrell Etherington Amazon gets into shoes and handbags with its new private fashion label ‘The Fix’38 minutes ago | Sarah Perez A race is underway to repair our hearing — with medicine1 hour ago | Connie Loizos Comment moderation powered by  Up NextA race is underway to repair our hearing — with medicinePosted 1 hour ago  CrunchBoardJob ListingsSoftware Engineer - Java (Contract) at Motorola Solutions (Seattle, WA, United States)Senior Android and IOS Developer (Contract) at Motorola Solutions (Seattle, WA, United States)Sr Software Engineer (Back End) at Etleap (San Francisco, CA, United States)Data Engineer at Etleap (San Francisco, CA, United States)Full Stack Developer at Laborocity (Radnor, PA, United States)More from CrunchBoardAdvertisementTechCrunchNewsVideoEventsCrunchbaseTechCrunch StoreAboutStaffContact UsAdvertise With UsEvent &amp; Editorial CalendarSend Us A TipActivations BlogInternationalChinaEuropeJapanFollow TechCrunchFacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInYoutubePinterestTumblrInstagramStumbleUponFeedTechCrunch AppsiOSAndroidWindows 8Subscribe to The Daily CrunchLatest headlines delivered to you dailySubscribe to &lt;span class=\"no-mobile\"&gt;Subscribe to &lt;/span&gt;The Daily CrunchEnter Email AddressSubscribe © 2013-2017 Oath Inc.

Named for computer science pioneer Alan Turing, the award is widely regarded as the highest distinction in Computer Science.Hellman and then-Stanford researcher Whitfield Diffie won the award for their fundamental contributions to modern cryptography. The two introduced the ideas of public-key cryptography and digital signatures, which laid the basis for most security protocols used on the Internet today.The two are integral contributors to the debate on computer and Internet privacy, and were at the forefront of what are now referred to as the first “crypto wars.” The two fought the NSA and other government agencies for the right to publish and disseminate their work to the broader public, instead of the small community of government users who wanted to keep encryption a closely guarded secret.We spoke to Professor Hellman at his home on Stanford University’s campus, discussing the work that led to the award, his fight for computer privacy and the current legal feud between Apple Computer and the Federal Bureau of Investigation over backdoors into the iOS mobile operating system.0SHARESAdvertisementAdvertisement CrunchBaseStanford University Founded1885OverviewStanford University makes a great fit for the academically driven\\rstudent.

He was just referring to the \"lock them in\" part. Right? Have something to add to this story?

It may contain references to unavailable content that is part of the larger resource.The following are good practices that you should employ to take care of your Puppet servers.Indenting HeredocHeredoc format can suppress leading spaces, allowing you to maintain indentation in the code without this showing up to the user:   else {     if( $keeping_up_with_jones ) {       $message_text = @(END)         This is a bit of a rat race, don't you think $username?         All this running about, for $effort and $gain,         the results of which we can't see at all.         |- END     }   }Furthermore, you can tell Heredoc the syntax inside the block and it can validate the syntax for you. Geppetto will display it according to the appropriate syntax scheme:$certificates = @(END:json)   {     \"private_key\": \"-----RSA PRIVATE KEY----...\",     \"public_key\": \"-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----...\",     \"certificate\": \"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----...\"   }   | ENDSplaying Puppet Agent Cron JobsIf you run Puppet from cron and use Puppet or any shared data sources, you can't run them all at the same time or you will overload the data source. In situations with only a few hundred nodes, you can simply use the splay feature and the random distribution will be random enough:cron { 'puppet-agent':  ensure      =&gt; present,  environment =&gt; 'PATH=/usr/bin:/opt/puppetlabs/bin'  command     =&gt; 'puppet agent --onetime --no-daemonize --splay --splaylimit 30m\",  user        =&gt; 'root',  minute      =&gt; 0,}In my experience, after a few hundred nodes you'll find that a quarter of them end up in the same three minutes and you'll experience the \"thundering herd\" phenomenon. At that point, you'll want a mechanism to guarantee a more consistent spread of hosts.The way to do this is to have the server calculate a different minute number for each node, and add the cron resource to its catalog with that minute. The number selection must be consistent, as random numbers will change on each connection.The easiest way with zero development on your part is to use the fqdn_rand(minutes,string) function, which will always produce the same value between 0 and the minutes provided. If you don't provide a string, it will use the current node name as salt. It is possible to supply any value (which doesn't change on a node) as salt. Here are some of my favorite sources for the string:Any unique identifier for each node, such as a serial number.The node's IP address. The unique fe80:: address is always good.Node certificate name or fully qualified domain name.A unique identifier for each node from an internal datastore.It really doesn't matter how you generate the source number for the node, so long as it is evenly distributed and does not change often. However you generate the number, add 30 for the second run. Place both of these numbers in a resource like so:$minute = fqdn_rand( 30, $facts['certname'] )cron { 'puppet-agent':  ensure  =&gt; present,  command =&gt; '/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet agent --onetime --no-daemonize',  user    =&gt; 'root',  minute  =&gt; [ $minute, $minute+30 ]}Cleaning Puppet ReportsThe reports created by Puppet nodes are never removed by the server. You'll have to add jobs to clean them up. Shown here is a resource for your server to clean up reports after 90 days:cron { 'clean-puppetserver-reports':  command =&gt; 'find /var/opt/puppetlabs/puppetserver/reports -ctime +90 -delete',  user    =&gt; 'root',  minute  =&gt; '2',  hour    =&gt; '3',}While it's not likely to fill up quite so fast, the same problem does exist for the node itself. Here's a resource to apply to every node to clean up the reports once a month:cron { 'clean-puppet-agent-reports':  command =&gt; 'find /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/cache/reports -ctime +90 -delete',  user    =&gt; 'root',  day     =&gt; '1',  minute  =&gt; '2',  hour    =&gt; '3',}Adjust the timing of the runs and the retention length to meet your own needs. In many environments we centrally archive the reports on long-term storage, and delete reports older than two days on the node every night.

Among other things, the FCC asked whether the cable industry will pledge to make DVR (digital video recording), fast forwarding, and rewinding available on third-party devices, but the NCTA did not propose that cable companies meet this standard.Further ReadingSet-top saga: Comcast says it\\u2019s \\u201cnot feasible\\u201d to comply with FCC cable box rulesThe NCTA said customers won't have to pay extra for using third-party apps and boxes but left the door open for other methods\\u00a0of jacking up customers' prices.The cable lobby proposal would require pay-TV companies with at least one million subscribers to build HTML5 applications for third-party devices, making it easier for consumers to avoid renting set-top boxes from cable companies. But while the proposed applications would have to provide all linear and on-demand programming, they wouldn't be required to let customers record video.If the industry proposal is accepted, MVPDs (multichannel video programming distributors) could offer recording in apps for third-party devices if they choose to do so, or they could restrict recording to their own hardware so that customers would have to pay box rental fees in order to record.This stands in contrast to the FCC proposal,\\u00a0which would force pay-TV providers to make video programming\\u2014and the right to record video\\u2014available to the makers of third-party devices and software.\\u00a0If the FCC sticks with its own plan, customers could choose applications or set-top boxes made by either their cable company or third-party manufacturers.The NCTA's recording concerns seem to be related to copyright. Even though the industry filing says that \\\"MVPD apps protect copyright,\\\" it also says that pay-TV operators have \\\"serious and legitimate concerns about recording of content that is decoupled from an MVPD\\u2019s app.\\\" Even though the recording would be done only through a cable company app, the NCTA appears to be worried that video could be distributed illegally once it is downloaded onto the hard drive of a third-party device. Comcast's implementation of a cloud-based DVR solves this problem, but apparently the NCTA doesn't want to require that other providers implement something like it.\\\"We are saying that app recording is possible and highlight how Comcast intends to do it with cloud DVR functionality,\\\" an NCTA spokesperson told Ars. \\\"It is not required as part of the apps proposal, but that doesn\\u2019t mean that it won\\u2019t be a feature that is available.\\\"No more compromisingThe NCTA appears unwilling to compromise on recording or any other issues related to its proposal. In a blog post today, the NCTA warned against taking portions of the FCC proposal and adding them to the cable industry's apps proposal. Such \\\"bolting on\\\" is \\\"merely trying to pour old wine in new bottles in an effort to subvert the virtues of the app proposal,\\\" the NCTA wrote.While the blog post doesn't mention recording, the\\u00a0NCTA spokesperson brought up the group's concerns about copyright and \\\"bolting on\\\" new requirements in response to our question about recording.PriceThe NCTA's filing says that consumers would save money under its proposal, but there's a caveat that could undermine that goal.Pay-TV companies would license their apps to third-party devices and app stores without charge, as long as those third parties don't impose any extra charges on MVPDs or consumers. Additionally, \\\"there is no box charge or app charge to the consumer beyond the standard fees that apply to their cable service,\\\" the NCTA said.The caveat is that the NCTA says that its proposal \\\"does not address service pricing. For example, AT&T service pricing may continue to vary with the number of outlets in the home, as does its current pricing today, but there would be no box charge or app charge for devices served with its HTML5 app.\\\"We're trying to get further clarification from AT&T and the NCTA. But if we understand this correctly, customers could be charged more for using additional wall outlets\\u2014with each outlet connecting to either a first-party or third-party box\\u2014but these charges are described as being separate from \\\"box charges.\\\"No gateways, no InternetThe cable company apps would not deliver video over the Internet, even though they could be used on third-party boxes that also deliver Internet services such as Netflix.\\\"The MVPD app would be delivered using technologies that match its purpose as a software replacement for the set-top box for use in the customer\\u2019s premises for delivery of a Title VI cable service (or MVPD service by satellite or IPTV operators),\\\" the NCTA said. \\\"The cable HTML5 app would be offered over managed IP channels, not over the Internet.\\\"This means the cable TV apps would not count against Internet data caps and would not be subject to net neutrality rules, just like cable TV service delivered over a standard rented set-top box.The cable industry also said that its apps proposal would not require customers to get a new \\\"gateway\\\" device from cable companies. The same cable modem that delivers Internet service would also deliver the non-Internet cable TV content.Satellite TV apps will be different. \\\"Because of satellite\\u2019s one-way architecture, satellite subscribers would need one satellite-provided device to bring the satellite signal to the home and provide features competitive with two-way services, but satellite providers would also offer downloadable HTML5 apps for third-party smart TVs and other TV-connected devices at the customer premises that connect to the satellite-provided device,\\\" the NCTA said.Customers without Internet service could also access cable company apps with a standard cable modem. That modem could be owned by the customer or rented from the cable company, the NCTA said.The NCTA claims that the FCC's proposal would require pay-TV companies \\\"to create a new hardware gateway device in the home\\\" to\\u00a0implement new network protocols. Advocates for the FCC plan say that's not true, and the\\u00a0FCC plan itself\\u00a0would\\u00a0require at least some\\u00a0cable companies\\u00a0to comply\\u00a0without building new boxes for customers' homes. Under the FCC proposal, MVPDs that make programming available on\\u00a0apps without requiring their\\u00a0own equipment would have to make video content available to third-party app and device makers without requiring MVPD-specific hardware.FCC commissioners haven't yet said when they will vote on a final proposal. There appears to be room to compromise, as Democratic Commissioner Jessica\\u00a0Rosenworcel has raised concerns about the FCC's original plan being \\\"too complicated\\\" and potentially introducing\\u00a0copyright problems.Jon Brodkin      Jon is Ars Technica's senior IT reporter, covering the FCC and broadband, telecommunications, wireless technology, and more.

In recent weeks he has found himself at the center of a debate over the influence money can have on journalism, and by extension, free speech. Thiel\\u00a0paid the lawyer who worked for Hulk Hogan in his suit against Gawker Media, eventually winning a massive judgement that led\\u00a0Gawker to declare bankruptcy. Thiel acknowledged the vendetta, which stems from a Gawker story published a decade earlier that outed him as gay, something Thiel wanted to keep private, or at least, out of the press.Thiel had been funding the lawsuit anonymously against Gawker Media. In fact, he paid the lawyer to\\u00a0litigate several cases, of which the Hogan case was simply the most successful. He has also made a name for himself as an advocate for an offshore libertarian state, a singularity university funder, and Donald Trump delegate.Like many other companies in Silicon Valley, Facebook has multiple classes of shares, only some of which are available to the public for purchase. That means that founder Mark Zuckerberg and other members of the board essentially\\u00a0have unilateral control on all votes, as their shares weigh far more heavily in the final tally. All that means is that, unless public outrage over Thiel's actions against Gawker grows far stronger, his seat on the board of the social network site is likely safe.\",\n          \"Bar carts save space and keep all your drink supplies handy, but can be expensive, if you find a good one.

Conversation toolsGo to permalinkRichard Branson at a mental health conference in April 2016 (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)“I hope in five years a reusable rocket will have been developed which can take up to 10 people at a time to stay at the Virgin Hotel for two weeks,” Richard Branson proudly announced back in 1999.AdvertisementWe’re still waiting on Branson’s Virgin Galactic to take tourists into space, despite the promises of the past two decades that he would do just that. But Branson has a new idea for the meantime: Why not launch small satellites into space? Called Virgin Orbit, Branson’s newest space venture will be led by former Boeing executive Dan Hart. “By offering low cost and frequent service to space, the team is revolutionizing the small satellite market within the promising space economy,” Branson bragged on his blog.AdvertisementBranson’s space strategy, however, is a little odd, so we’ve come up with a name for it: The Reverse Musk™. How do you pull off a Reverse Musk™? You start with the really hard stuff and then give up and try the more humble projects you should’ve been working on two decades ago.Elon Musk founded SpaceX in 2002 with bold dreams of eventually propelling humans into space—to Mars and beyond. But Musk realized that you had to start with the more modest stuff. Over the next decade, SpaceX built rockets and sent capsules to the International Space Station, and launched satellites.And all of those things paid off. Musk now talks about how he wants to send space tourists around the moon by the end of 2018. And even though it’s a tremendously ambitious goal, some people believe he can do it. Why? Musk started with the “smaller” stuff like launching satellites. Getting humans to the moon and Mars may have been the ultimate goal, but Musk clearly knew that you had to learn to walk before you could run.SponsoredBranson has always been about the opposite. Yes, he’s been developing his own rockets, and spaceships—one that tragically and infamously exploded in 2014, killing a pilot. But he only recently pursued private contracts to do the more modest stuff, like launching satellites into space, that ultimately teaches lessons that you can use for manned space travel. Branson did, however, get the state of New Mexico to pay $250 million for a spaceship graveyard. So it’s not like he wasn’t busy spending other people’s money. Just not in a way that benefited very many people.AdvertisementAdvertisement“It has been my longheld dream to open access to space to change the world for good,” Branson said in a statement about his new company. “We have been striving to do that by manufacturing vehicles of the future, enabling the small satellite revolution, and preparing commercial space flight for many more humans to reach space and see our home planet.”“I’m thrilled that our small satellite launch service has now progressed to the point it merits the formation of its own company, Virgin Orbit, and a new president in Dan  with decades of deep experience and success in a broad variety of space programs.”Will Virgin Orbit be successful? Hopefully. But it’s really something he should’ve started with back in the 2000s.Advertisement“Virgin Galactic officials said 100 people already have paid $200,000 apiece to fly into space,” a story from the Associated Press in 2005 promised. “They include actress Victoria Principal, who told the news conference she looked forward to being on the first civilian flight of Virgin Galactic, perhaps as soon as 2008.”Like we said, we’re still rooting for Branson’s The Reverse Musk™, even if he has almost 20 years of failed promises in his wake. Hopefully this one takes off. Do you get it? I said, I hope this one takes off. Like the spaceships. They take off.Recommended Stories15 Years of Virgin Galactic's Failed Space Age PromisesHere Is Richard Branson Dressed as a MermaidVirgin Galactic Is Finally Back in the SkyMatt Novaknovak@gizmodo.com@paleofutureMatt Novak is the editor of Gizmodo's Paleofuture blogPGP Fingerprint: 0074 467E 1339 F416 DA8C 6CFA 0ABD A808 C05C D4A6|PGP KeyReply1 repliesLeave a replyYou may also likeJezebelWhat Is \"Birth Rape\"?9/08/10 10:15amFoxtrot AlphaVeterans Outraged At How Trump Exploited A SEAL Widow's Grief For HimselfYesterday 7:11pmKotakuThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild: The Kotaku ReviewToday 6:00amRecent from Matt Novak2014426.7KPaleofuture · Matt NovakJeff Sessions, Anti-Weed Crusader, Was a Shill For Big TobaccoYesterday 9:45am85745.4KGizmodo · Matt NovakPhotoshop Contest: Oscars Fuck-up EditionMonday 8:50am2440337.9KGizmodo · Matt NovakCrowdfunding Is the Only Way Americans Know How to Mourn After Engineer Is Killed by Terrorist2/24/17 7:50amShareTweetAbout BlogNeed Help?Content GuideGizmodo StoreRedirecting to the Gizmodo store in  Disclaimer: You are leaving a Gizmodo Media Group, LLC website and going to a third party site, which is subject to its own privacy policy and terms of use.ContinuePermissionsPrivacyTerms of UseAdvertisingJobsRSS©2017 Gizmodo Media GroupKinja is in read-only mode.

seedsbagelsmuffinsdrugsdrug testsstudiesvideos6EditPromoteShare to KinjaToggle Conversation toolsGo to permalinkTales of poppy seed-covered foods being the cause of failed drug tests is a classic urban legend that’s been floating around since a certain episode of Seinfeld. While there may be some truth behind the myth, poppy seeds aren’t likely to ruin your drug test anymore.AdvertisementIn this video from the SciShow YouTube channel, Olivia Gordon explains the science of poppy seeds, opiates, and typical drug screening tests. If you weren’t aware, morphine and other opiates come from the same plant as poppy seeds: Papaver somniferum, or the opium poppy. So, it’s possible that poppy seeds—like you’d find on a bagel or in a muffin—carry the same chemical components as the opiates drug tests typically look for. However, the truth is the trace amounts of opiates that may have ended up on those poppy seeds don’t come anywhere close to the amount in an actual dose of morphine or other hard opiates. Urine tests are pretty sensitive, and those poppy seeds from your breakfast might show up, but it won’t be enough to raise a red flag. Furthermore, the threshold for opiates found in urine was raised back in the early 2000s from .3 micrograms per milliliter to 2 micrograms per milliliter, which is a massive gap. If you’re really worried about it, avoid consuming poppy seeds for a few days before your test. But don’t sweat it if you had a tasty poppy seed muffin that morning either.The Truths Behind Eight Common \"Old Wives' Tales\"The Truths Behind Eight Common \"Old Wives' Tales\"The Truths Behind Eight Common \"Old Wives' Tales\"Whether you heard them from friends or family, you've probably heard things that sound either…Read more Read moreCan Poppy Seeds Make You Fail a Drug Test? | YouTubePatrick Allanpatrick.allan@lifehacker.com@mr_patrickallanStaff Writer, Lifehacker.comReply6 repliesLeave a replyYou may also likeThe RootConn.

HomeComments 136SharesShareTweetShareSaveDevindra Hardawar/AOLAmazon's been expanding its line of smart, Alexa-powered home speakers for awhile now. If you're interested in buying an Amazon Echo, well then today is your lucky day. The smart speaker, which usually is priced at $180, is on sale for just $90 at select retailers today. You can also grab an Amazon Echo Dot for $35, a $15 discount off its regular price of $50, and an Amazon Tap for $80, discounted from the regular price of $130.It's strange that these devices would be on sale at third-party stores and not Amazon itself (not only is the Echo showing as full price, but it's out of stock, with an estimated ship date of August 11. However, you can pick up a discounted device at stores such as  Bed Bath & Beyond, Best Buy and Bloomingdale's. We've seen sales on the Echo before, but this seems to be the steepest discount yet. If you want to take advantage of this offer, make sure you grab one before midnight tonight, Central time.

There was the Smart Ultra 6, which was one of the best affordable phones of its time, and the Smart Platinum 7, which was an interesting step into more expensive, sub-flagship category. But alongside those, there have been a number of humdrum handsets that failed to impress. As per its yearly update cycle, Vodafone recently released new own-brand hardware, with the Smart V8 in particular slotting into the carrier's roster as one of the best affordable options.            Gallery: Vodafone Smart V8 | 16 Photos                       16                                +12                    The most immediately striking feature of the Smart V8 when you free it from its box is the build quality. It's almost entirely brushed metal aside from two pockets of textured plastic, with neatly chamfered edges and loudspeaker grilles. While it's not pushing the boundaries of design by any means, it certainly looks and feels like it's punching above the £159 pay-as-you-go price point.The spec sheet isn't to be taken lightly either. You're looking at a 5.5-inch, 1080p LCD display, an octa-core 1.4GHz Snapdragon 435, 3 gigs of RAM, 32GB of expandable storage, a 16-megapixel primary camera and 8MP front-facer, all powered by a decent-sized 3,000mAh battery. You also get a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor and NFC chip -- hello Android Pay. Perhaps even more important, the Smart V8 is running Android 7.1.1, so it's basically as up-to-date as you can get on the software front.It's more or less the stock Android experience, albeit with a few borderline-bloatware apps from Vodafone added in. One quirk I've discovered worth noting is I can't seem to resize widgets on the homescreen. Not a huge deal, but it does mean the digital clock widget is naturally off-centre, which is slightly irritating.In sunny summer conditions, the 16MP camera can be pretty handy. Good colour saturation, clarity, and contrast thanks to the HDR mode. The app is pretty busy with filters and features and settings, from full manual control to long exposure and \"active photo\" modes (kinda like GIFs/Live Photos). You won't find much help in them in low-light conditions, though, where the camera begins to fall off fairly quickly.             Gallery: Vodafone Smart V8 camera samples | 13 Photos                       13                                +9                    All in all, there's nothing particularly special about the Smart V8. These days, metalwork, this kind of spec sheet and value-added features like fingerprint sensor and NFC are becoming standard at the mid-to-low end. The new handset does have something going for it, though -- a pretty competitive price tag.Vodafone's pay-as-you-go range is relatively sparse around the £150 mark. You've got the £149 Sony Xperia L1, which is less attractive enough on paper to justify the jump to the £159 Smart V8. The closest handset beyond that point is the fairly comparable £199 Huawei P8 lite (2017). The Moto G5 gets a nod too, obviously, as well as the Wileyfox Swift 2, since they can be bought elsewhere for bang on £159. You wouldn't say either of them are significantly better than the Smart V8, though.Smart N8If you've set yourself a slightly tighter budget, Vodafone also recently launched the Smart N8, an £85 handset sitting in the crowded low-end of the pay-as-you-go spectrum. It's more than appropriately specced, with a 5-inch, 720p display, quad-core 1.3GHz MediaTek chip, 1.5GB of RAM, 16 gigs of expandable storage, 13- and 5-megapixel cameras, fingerprint sensor, NFC and 2,400mAh battery.Despite looking a little on the drab side, it's a decent value device. You could always save yourself a London pint and opt for the £79 Moto G4 Play instead, which recently began receiving Android Nougat, but you would be sacrificing the fingerprint reader/NFC combo. But that's true of most other devices dipping below the £100 marker at the moment.Smart Tab N8While the two smartphones have obvious places in Vodafone's backroom, the new Smart Tab N8 is where things get confusing. The draw of pretty much all own-brand tablets is ultimate portability, thanks to 4G, at a reasonable cost. I wouldn't call the Smart Tab N8 very portable though, because it's massive. It's not that heavy at 465g and it's pretty thin, too, with 8.95mm between the glass front and textured, tactile plastic back -- it's that it's all face.             Gallery: Vodafone Smart Tab N8 | 9 Photos                       9                                +5                    Not only does the slate carry a 10.1-inch display, but a significant bloating of bezel around it. It's not something you could slip into a handbag and it not be a nuisance, let's say. Worse yet, that 10.1-inch screen runs at a very noticeable 1,280 x 800 resolution, making it easy to pick out individual pixels. Large tablets are typically geared more towards entertainment, but 149 ppi doesn't really cut it nowadays.The other specs are largely irrelevant: A quad-core 1.1GHz MediaTek processor, 2 gigs of RAM, 16GB of expandable storage, 4,600mAh battery and 5MP/2MP cameras on the appropriate sides. Vodafone is selling the Smart Tab N8 on contracts starting at £16 per month for a 5GB data cap and no upfront payment. I'd sooner get exactly the same plan with Samsung's 10.1-inch Galaxy Tab A (2016), since it's been upgraded to Nougat already and waves a more alluring spec sheet, the 1,920 x 1,200 display being the most important upgrade. Hits and misses for Vodafone again, it would appear.

Apple VP of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives Lisa Jackson knows this perfectly well as she’s responsible for making sure that Apple doesn’t make any compromise in favor of unrestrained growth. That’s why we’re excited to talk with Lisa Jackson on stage at Disrupt SF 2017 about the other side of tech.Jackson’s role at Apple encompasses so many different things. She’s the one responsible for minimizing Apple’s impact on the environment. Apple is building data centers that run 100 percent on renewable energy. But it is also concerned about the impact of its retail stores and offices.Apple also sells tens of millions of devices every quarter. The company needs to make sure that it comes in tiny packages so that it uses fewer planes, boats and trucks. And those packages are made out of paper. The company is trying to protect forests used in the production of paper packaging for Apple items.The company doesn’t want to mine the Earth until there’s no resources left. Apple is trying to use recycled material as much as possible in order to protect the Earth. And of course, Apple is trying to get back and recycle as many broken or unused devices at the end of their life cycle as possible.Apple is not perfect and it definitely feels like a work in progress, but Apple is also communicating a lot on those issues and regularly sharing updates about their various environmental projects.And protecting the Earth is just one aspect. Jackson is also trying to protect human rights and looking at Apple’s social impact. That’s why Apple stopped relying on cobalt from Congo after learning about child labor. The company is working with so many different suppliers that it needs to implement strong processes to find out if everyone is paid fairly under acceptable working conditions.Social issues aren’t limited to factories overseas. Tech companies have a responsibility when it comes to hiring and promoting a diverse pool of talent. That’s why Apple appointed its first-ever VP of Diversity and Inclusion Denise Young Smith earlier this year.And finally, Apple and other tech companies have become so big that they have a responsibility when it comes to policy changes. Everybody remembers the San Bernardino encryption case — Apple took a strong stance against the FBI and in favor of privacy.Under President Donald Trump’s administration, Silicon Valley leaders often strongly disagree with some of his decisions or tweets. It’s going to be interesting to discuss how Silicon Valley can have a say in those decisions.If you want to hear our discussion with Lisa Jackson, grab an early-bird ticket to Disrupt.

Named for computer science pioneer Alan Turing, the award is widely regarded as the highest distinction in Computer Science.Hellman and then-Stanford researcher Whitfield Diffie won the award for their fundamental contributions to modern cryptography. The two introduced the ideas of public-key cryptography and digital signatures, which laid the basis for most security protocols used on the Internet today.The two are integral contributors to the debate on computer and Internet privacy, and were at the forefront of what are now referred to as the first “crypto wars.” The two fought the NSA and other government agencies for the right to publish and disseminate their work to the broader public, instead of the small community of government users who wanted to keep encryption a closely guarded secret.We spoke to Professor Hellman at his home on Stanford University’s campus, discussing the work that led to the award, his fight for computer privacy and the current legal feud between Apple Computer and the Federal Bureau of Investigation over backdoors into the iOS mobile operating system.0SHARESAdvertisementAdvertisement CrunchBaseStanford University Founded1885OverviewStanford University makes a great fit for the academically driven\\rstudent.

Saturday, April 30, 2016.Image:  AP Photo/Susan WalshBy Brittany Levine Beckman2016-05-01 05:19:20 UTCTired of Senate Republicans refusing to approve his Supreme Court nominee, President Barack Obama may be compelled to take extreme measures. Westeros-style.At his final White House Correspondents' Dinner Saturday, Obama, a Game of Thrones fan, noted there were quite a few Republican senators seated in the cavernous Washington Hilton ballroom during his speech, making it the perfect time to officially fill the late Justice Antonin Scalia's seat with his pick, Judge Merrick Garland.SEE ALSO: Obama can't wait to wear mom jeans after he leaves the White House\"They're in the house, which reminds me, security, bar the doors. Judge Merrick Garland come on out. We're going to do this right here, right now,\" Obama said. \"It's like the Red Wedding.\"WATCH: @POTUS tries to get Merrick Garland confirmed at the #WHCD: \"It's like the Red Wedding.\" https://t.co/McDTrBWMc6— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) May 1, 2016Obama (in)famously received an early look at Game of Thrones' sixth season, making the rest of us show lovers, and especially Jon Snow fans, feel like the peasants of King's Landing. As Game of Thrones watchers know, Jon Snow's half-brother, Robb Stark, his wife, mother and his army were slaughtered after being barricaded in a room following his uncle's nuptials, hence the devastating Red Wedding.Of course, Obama didn't want to take it that far at an event jokingly known as the nerd prom. He was just referring to the \"lock them in\" part. Right? Have something to add to this story?

By  Jo Rhett April 25, 2016Departure board at night                            (source: James Creegan via Flickr).                      This is an excerpt from Learning Puppet 4, by Jo Rhett. It may contain references to unavailable content that is part of the larger resource.The following are good practices that you should employ to take care of your Puppet servers.Indenting HeredocHeredoc format can suppress leading spaces, allowing you to maintain indentation in the code without this showing up to the user:   else {     if( $keeping_up_with_jones ) {       $message_text = @(END)         This is a bit of a rat race, don't you think $username?         All this running about, for $effort and $gain,         the results of which we can't see at all.         |- END     }   }Furthermore, you can tell Heredoc the syntax inside the block and it can validate the syntax for you. Geppetto will display it according to the appropriate syntax scheme:$certificates = @(END:json)   {     \"private_key\": \"-----RSA PRIVATE KEY----...\",     \"public_key\": \"-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----...\",     \"certificate\": \"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----...\"   }   | ENDSplaying Puppet Agent Cron JobsIf you run Puppet from cron and use Puppet or any shared data sources, you can't run them all at the same time or you will overload the data source. In situations with only a few hundred nodes, you can simply use the splay feature and the random distribution will be random enough:cron { 'puppet-agent':  ensure      => present,  environment => 'PATH=/usr/bin:/opt/puppetlabs/bin'  command     => 'puppet agent --onetime --no-daemonize --splay --splaylimit 30m\",  user        => 'root',  minute      => 0,}In my experience, after a few hundred nodes you'll find that a quarter of them end up in the same three minutes and you'll experience the \"thundering herd\" phenomenon. At that point, you'll want a mechanism to guarantee a more consistent spread of hosts.The way to do this is to have the server calculate a different minute number for each node, and add the cron resource to its catalog with that minute. The number selection must be consistent, as random numbers will change on each connection.The easiest way with zero development on your part is to use the fqdn_rand(minutes,string) function, which will always produce the same value between 0 and the minutes provided. If you don't provide a string, it will use the current node name as salt. It is possible to supply any value (which doesn't change on a node) as salt. Here are some of my favorite sources for the string:Any unique identifier for each node, such as a serial number.The node's IP address. The unique fe80:: address is always good.Node certificate name or fully qualified domain name.A unique identifier for each node from an internal datastore.It really doesn't matter how you generate the source number for the node, so long as it is evenly distributed and does not change often. However you generate the number, add 30 for the second run. Place both of these numbers in a resource like so:$minute = fqdn_rand( 30, $facts['certname'] )cron { 'puppet-agent':  ensure  => present,  command => '/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet agent --onetime --no-daemonize',  user    => 'root',  minute  => [ $minute, $minute+30 ]}Cleaning Puppet ReportsThe reports created by Puppet nodes are never removed by the server. You'll have to add jobs to clean them up. Shown here is a resource for your server to clean up reports after 90 days:cron { 'clean-puppetserver-reports':  command => 'find /var/opt/puppetlabs/puppetserver/reports -ctime +90 -delete',  user    => 'root',  minute  => '2',  hour    => '3',}While it's not likely to fill up quite so fast, the same problem does exist for the node itself. Here's a resource to apply to every node to clean up the reports once a month:cron { 'clean-puppet-agent-reports':  command => 'find /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/cache/reports -ctime +90 -delete',  user    => 'root',  day     => '1',  minute  => '2',  hour    => '3',}Adjust the timing of the runs and the retention length to meet your own needs. In many environments we centrally archive the reports on long-term storage, and delete reports older than two days on the node every night.

This?Jon Bernthal as Frank Castle, A.K.A. the Punisher, in 'Daredevil' Season 2Image:  netflixBy Proma Khosla2016-04-29 13:57:51 UTCHell's Kitchen continues to burn. With success of Daredevil, the critical acclaim of Jessica Jones, and mounting excitement for Luke Cage and Iron Fist — all leading up to a Defenders miniseries — Marvel is adding another name to its slate of Netflix properties.SEE ALSO: 'Daredevil' Season 2 is crowded, which just means there's more to loveThe new series will focus on The Punisher, and will star Jon Bernthal in the title role — reprising a part he first played on Daredevil Season 2. Hannibal's Steve Lightfoot will serve as showrunner. News of the show was first reported by Entertainment Weekly and confirmed by Netflix on Friday. The Punisher was first introduced in Frank Miller's Daredevil comics as a vengeful and violent vigilante – a darker shade of Daredevil and a warning of what Matt Murdock could become if he veered off his chosen path. Castle is disillusioned by war and fueled by hatred, determined to avenge the deaths of his family and any other casualties of bigger battle.The Punisher series doesn't yet have a premiere date.Have something to add to this story?

being the cause of failed drug tests is a classic urban legend that’s been floating around since a certain episode of Seinfeld. While there may be some truth behind the myth, poppy seeds aren’t likely to ruin your drug test anymore.In this video from the SciShow YouTube channel, Olivia Gordon explains the science of poppy seeds, opiates, and typical drug screening tests. If you weren’t aware, morphine and other opiates come from the same plant as poppy seeds: Papaver somniferum, or the opium poppy. So, it’s possible that poppy seeds—like you’d find on a bagel or in a muffin—carry the same chemical components as the opiates drug tests typically look for. However, the truth is the trace amounts of opiates that may have ended up on those poppy seeds don’t come anywhere close to the amount in an actual dose of morphine or other hard opiates. Urine tests are pretty sensitive, and those poppy seeds from your breakfast might show up, but it won’t be enough to raise a red flag. Furthermore, the threshold for opiates found in urine was raised back in the early 2000s from .3 micrograms per milliliter to 2 micrograms per milliliter, which is a massive gap. If you’re really worried about it, avoid consuming poppy seeds for a few days before your test. But don’t sweat it if you had a tasty poppy seed muffin that morning either.Can Poppy Seeds Make You Fail a Drug Test? | YouTube   \n","2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Amazon's been expanding its line of smart, Alexa-powered home speakers for awhile now. If you're interested in buying an Amazon Echo, well then today is your lucky day. The smart speaker, which usually is priced at $180, is on sale for just $90 at select retailers today. You can also grab an Amazon Echo Dot for $35, a $15 discount off its regular price of $50, and an Amazon Tap for $80, discounted from the regular price of $130.It's strange that these devices would be on sale at third-party stores and not Amazon itself (not only is the Echo showing as full price, but it's out of stock, with an estimated ship date of August 11. However, you can pick up a discounted device at stores such as  Bed Bath & Beyond, Best Buy and Bloomingdale's. We've seen sales on the Echo before, but this seems to be the steepest discount yet. If you want to take advantage of this offer, make sure you grab one before midnight tonight, Central time.Source: The Verge   \n","3      Vodafone's own-brand devices have been hit and miss over the past few years. There was the Smart Ultra 6, which was one of the best affordable phones of its time, and the Smart Platinum 7, which was an interesting step into more expensive, sub-flagship category. But alongside those, there have been a number of humdrum handsets that failed to impress. As per its yearly update cycle, Vodafone recently released new own-brand hardware, with the Smart V8 in particular slotting into the carrier's roster as one of the best affordable options.The most immediately striking feature of the Smart V8 when you free it from its box is the build quality. It's almost entirely brushed metal aside from two pockets of textured plastic, with neatly chamfered edges and loudspeaker grilles. While it's not pushing the boundaries of design by any means, it certainly looks and feels like it's punching above the £159 pay-as-you-go price point.The spec sheet isn't to be taken lightly either. You're looking at a 5.5-inch, 1080p LCD display, an octa-core 1.4GHz Snapdragon 435, 3 gigs of RAM, 32GB of expandable storage, a 16-megapixel primary camera and 8MP front-facer, all powered by a decent-sized 3,000mAh battery. You also get a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor and NFC chip -- hello Android Pay. Perhaps even more important, the Smart V8 is running Android 7.1.1, so it's basically as up-to-date as you can get on the software front.It's more or less the stock Android experience, albeit with a few borderline-bloatware apps from Vodafone added in. One quirk I've discovered worth noting is I can't seem to resize widgets on the homescreen. Not a huge deal, but it does mean the digital clock widget is naturally off-centre, which is slightly irritating.In sunny summer conditions, the 16MP camera can be pretty handy. Good colour saturation, clarity, and contrast thanks to the HDR mode. The app is pretty busy with filters and features and settings, from full manual control to long exposure and \"active photo\" modes (kinda like GIFs/Live Photos). You won't find much help in them in low-light conditions, though, where the camera begins to fall off fairly quickly. All in all, there's nothing particularly special about the Smart V8. These days, metalwork, this kind of spec sheet and value-added features like fingerprint sensor and NFC are becoming standard at the mid-to-low end. The new handset does have something going for it, though -- a pretty competitive price tag.Vodafone's pay-as-you-go range is relatively sparse around the £150 mark. You've got the £149 Sony Xperia L1, which is less attractive enough on paper to justify the jump to the £159 Smart V8. The closest handset beyond that point is the fairly comparable £199 Huawei P8 lite (2017). The Moto G5 gets a nod too, obviously, as well as the Wileyfox Swift 2, since they can be bought elsewhere for bang on £159. You wouldn't say either of them are significantly better than the Smart V8, though.Smart N8If you've set yourself a slightly tighter budget, Vodafone also recently launched the Smart N8, an £85 handset sitting in the crowded low-end of the pay-as-you-go spectrum. It's more than appropriately specced, with a 5-inch, 720p display, quad-core 1.3GHz MediaTek chip, 1.5GB of RAM, 16 gigs of expandable storage, 13- and 5-megapixel cameras, fingerprint sensor, NFC and 2,400mAh battery.Despite looking a little on the drab side, it's a decent value device. You could always save yourself a London pint and opt for the £79 Moto G4 Play instead, which recently began receiving Android Nougat, but you would be sacrificing the fingerprint reader/NFC combo. But that's true of most other devices dipping below the £100 marker at the moment.Smart Tab N8While the two smartphones have obvious places in Vodafone's backroom, the new Smart Tab N8 is where things get confusing. The draw of pretty much all own-brand tablets is ultimate portability, thanks to 4G, at a reasonable cost. I wouldn't call the Smart Tab N8 very portable though, because it's massive. It's not that heavy at 465g and it's pretty thin, too, with 8.95mm between the glass front and textured, tactile plastic back -- it's that it's all face. Not only does the slate carry a 10.1-inch display, but a significant bloating of bezel around it. It's not something you could slip into a handbag and it not be a nuisance, let's say. Worse yet, that 10.1-inch screen runs at a very noticeable 1,280 x 800 resolution, making it easy to pick out individual pixels. Large tablets are typically geared more towards entertainment, but 149 ppi doesn't really cut it nowadays.The other specs are largely irrelevant: A quad-core 1.1GHz MediaTek processor, 2 gigs of RAM, 16GB of expandable storage, 4,600mAh battery and 5MP/2MP cameras on the appropriate sides. Vodafone is selling the Smart Tab N8 on contracts starting at £16 per month for a 5GB data cap and no upfront payment. I'd sooner get exactly the same plan with Samsung's 10.1-inch Galaxy Tab A (2016), since it's been upgraded to Nougat already and waves a more alluring spec sheet, the 1,920 x 1,200 display being the most important upgrade.

to permalinkRichard Branson at a mental health conference in April 2016 (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)“I hope in five years a reusable rocket will have been developed which can take up to 10 people at a time to stay at the Virgin Hotel for two weeks,” Richard Branson proudly announced back in 1999.AdvertisementWe’re still waiting on Branson’s Virgin Galactic to take tourists into space, despite the promises of the past two decades that he would do just that. But Branson has a new idea for the meantime: Why not launch small satellites into space? Called Virgin Orbit, Branson’s newest space venture will be led by former Boeing executive Dan Hart. “By offering low cost and frequent service to space, the team is revolutionizing the small satellite market within the promising space economy,” Branson bragged on his blog.AdvertisementBranson’s space strategy, however, is a little odd, so we’ve come up with a name for it: The Reverse Musk™. How do you pull off a Reverse Musk™? You start with the really hard stuff and then give up and try the more humble projects you should’ve been working on two decades ago.Elon Musk founded SpaceX in 2002 with bold dreams of eventually propelling humans into space—to Mars and beyond. But Musk realized that you had to start with the more modest stuff. Over the next decade, SpaceX built rockets and sent capsules to the International Space Station, and launched satellites.And all of those things paid off. Musk now talks about how he wants to send space tourists around the moon by the end of 2018. And even though it’s a tremendously ambitious goal, some people believe he can do it. Why? Musk started with the “smaller” stuff like launching satellites. Getting humans to the moon and Mars may have been the ultimate goal, but Musk clearly knew that you had to learn to walk before you could run.SponsoredBranson has always been about the opposite. Yes, he’s been developing his own rockets, and spaceships—one that tragically and infamously exploded in 2014, killing a pilot. But he only recently pursued private contracts to do the more modest stuff, like launching satellites into space, that ultimately teaches lessons that you can use for manned space travel. Branson did, however, get the state of New Mexico to pay $250 million for a spaceship graveyard. So it’s not like he wasn’t busy spending other people’s money. Just not in a way that benefited very many people.AdvertisementAdvertisement“It has been my longheld dream to open access to space to change the world for good,” Branson said in a statement about his new company. “We have been striving to do that by manufacturing vehicles of the future, enabling the small satellite revolution, and preparing commercial space flight for many more humans to reach space and see our home planet.”“I’m thrilled that our small satellite launch service has now progressed to the point it merits the formation of its own company, Virgin Orbit, and a new president in Dan  with decades of deep experience and success in a broad variety of space programs.”Will Virgin Orbit be successful? Hopefully. But it’s really something he should’ve started with back in the 2000s.Advertisement“Virgin Galactic officials said 100 people already have paid $200,000 apiece to fly into space,” a story from the Associated Press in 2005 promised. “They include actress Victoria Principal, who told the news conference she looked forward to being on the first civilian flight of Virgin Galactic, perhaps as soon as 2008.”Like we said, we’re still rooting for Branson’s The Reverse Musk™, even if he has almost 20 years of failed promises in his wake. Hopefully this one takes off. Do you get it? I said, I hope this one takes off. Like the spaceships. They take off.Recommended Stories15 Years of Virgin Galactic's Failed Space Age PromisesHere Is Richard Branson Dressed as a MermaidVirgin Galactic Is Finally Back in the SkyMatt Novaknovak@gizmodo.com@paleofutureMatt Novak is the editor of Gizmodo's Paleofuture blogPGP Fingerprint: 0074 467E 1339 F416 DA8C 6CFA 0ABD A808 C05C D4A6|PGP KeyReply1 repliesLeave a replyYou may also likeJezebelWhat Is \"Birth Rape\"?9/08/10 10:15amFoxtrot AlphaVeterans Outraged At How Trump Exploited A SEAL Widow's Grief For HimselfYesterday 7:11pmKotakuThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild: The Kotaku ReviewToday 6:00amRecent from Matt Novak2014426.7KPaleofuture · Matt NovakJeff Sessions, Anti-Weed Crusader, Was a Shill For Big TobaccoYesterday 9:45am85745.4KGizmodo · Matt NovakPhotoshop Contest: Oscars Fuck-up EditionMonday 8:50am2440337.9KGizmodo · Matt NovakCrowdfunding Is the Only Way Americans Know How to Mourn After Engineer Is Killed by Terrorist2/24/17 7:50amShareTweetAbout BlogNeed Help?Content GuideGizmodo StoreRedirecting to the Gizmodo store in  Disclaimer: You are leaving a Gizmodo Media Group, LLC website and going to a third party site, which is subject to its own privacy policy and terms of use.ContinuePermissionsPrivacyTerms of UseAdvertisingJobsRSS©2017 Gizmodo Media GroupKinja is in read-only mode.

While there may be some truth behind the myth, poppy seeds aren’t likely to ruin your drug test anymore.AdvertisementIn this video from the SciShow YouTube channel, Olivia Gordon explains the science of poppy seeds, opiates, and typical drug screening tests. If you weren’t aware, morphine and other opiates come from the same plant as poppy seeds: Papaver somniferum, or the opium poppy. So, it’s possible that poppy seeds—like you’d find on a bagel or in a muffin—carry the same chemical components as the opiates drug tests typically look for. However, the truth is the trace amounts of opiates that may have ended up on those poppy seeds don’t come anywhere close to the amount in an actual dose of morphine or other hard opiates. Urine tests are pretty sensitive, and those poppy seeds from your breakfast might show up, but it won’t be enough to raise a red flag. Furthermore, the threshold for opiates found in urine was raised back in the early 2000s from .3 micrograms per milliliter to 2 micrograms per milliliter, which is a massive gap. If you’re really worried about it, avoid consuming poppy seeds for a few days before your test.

There was the Smart Ultra 6, which was one of the best affordable phones of its time, and the Smart Platinum 7, which was an interesting step into more expensive, sub-flagship category. But alongside those, there have been a number of humdrum handsets that failed to impress. As per its yearly update cycle, Vodafone recently released new own-brand hardware, with the Smart V8 in particular slotting into the carrier's roster as one of the best affordable options.            Gallery: Vodafone Smart V8 | 16 Photos                       16                                +12                    The most immediately striking feature of the Smart V8 when you free it from its box is the build quality. It's almost entirely brushed metal aside from two pockets of textured plastic, with neatly chamfered edges and loudspeaker grilles. While it's not pushing the boundaries of design by any means, it certainly looks and feels like it's punching above the £159 pay-as-you-go price point.The spec sheet isn't to be taken lightly either. You're looking at a 5.5-inch, 1080p LCD display, an octa-core 1.4GHz Snapdragon 435, 3 gigs of RAM, 32GB of expandable storage, a 16-megapixel primary camera and 8MP front-facer, all powered by a decent-sized 3,000mAh battery. You also get a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor and NFC chip -- hello Android Pay. Perhaps even more important, the Smart V8 is running Android 7.1.1, so it's basically as up-to-date as you can get on the software front.It's more or less the stock Android experience, albeit with a few borderline-bloatware apps from Vodafone added in. One quirk I've discovered worth noting is I can't seem to resize widgets on the homescreen. Not a huge deal, but it does mean the digital clock widget is naturally off-centre, which is slightly irritating.In sunny summer conditions, the 16MP camera can be pretty handy. Good colour saturation, clarity, and contrast thanks to the HDR mode. The app is pretty busy with filters and features and settings, from full manual control to long exposure and \"active photo\" modes (kinda like GIFs/Live Photos). You won't find much help in them in low-light conditions, though, where the camera begins to fall off fairly quickly.             Gallery: Vodafone Smart V8 camera samples | 13 Photos                       13                                +9                    All in all, there's nothing particularly special about the Smart V8. These days, metalwork, this kind of spec sheet and value-added features like fingerprint sensor and NFC are becoming standard at the mid-to-low end. The new handset does have something going for it, though -- a pretty competitive price tag.Vodafone's pay-as-you-go range is relatively sparse around the £150 mark. You've got the £149 Sony Xperia L1, which is less attractive enough on paper to justify the jump to the £159 Smart V8. The closest handset beyond that point is the fairly comparable £199 Huawei P8 lite (2017). The Moto G5 gets a nod too, obviously, as well as the Wileyfox Swift 2, since they can be bought elsewhere for bang on £159. You wouldn't say either of them are significantly better than the Smart V8, though.Smart N8If you've set yourself a slightly tighter budget, Vodafone also recently launched the Smart N8, an £85 handset sitting in the crowded low-end of the pay-as-you-go spectrum. It's more than appropriately specced, with a 5-inch, 720p display, quad-core 1.3GHz MediaTek chip, 1.5GB of RAM, 16 gigs of expandable storage, 13- and 5-megapixel cameras, fingerprint sensor, NFC and 2,400mAh battery.Despite looking a little on the drab side, it's a decent value device. You could always save yourself a London pint and opt for the £79 Moto G4 Play instead, which recently began receiving Android Nougat, but you would be sacrificing the fingerprint reader/NFC combo. But that's true of most other devices dipping below the £100 marker at the moment.Smart Tab N8While the two smartphones have obvious places in Vodafone's backroom, the new Smart Tab N8 is where things get confusing. The draw of pretty much all own-brand tablets is ultimate portability, thanks to 4G, at a reasonable cost. I wouldn't call the Smart Tab N8 very portable though, because it's massive. It's not that heavy at 465g and it's pretty thin, too, with 8.95mm between the glass front and textured, tactile plastic back -- it's that it's all face.             Gallery: Vodafone Smart Tab N8 | 9 Photos                       9                                +5                    Not only does the slate carry a 10.1-inch display, but a significant bloating of bezel around it. It's not something you could slip into a handbag and it not be a nuisance, let's say. Worse yet, that 10.1-inch screen runs at a very noticeable 1,280 x 800 resolution, making it easy to pick out individual pixels. Large tablets are typically geared more towards entertainment, but 149 ppi doesn't really cut it nowadays.The other specs are largely irrelevant: A quad-core 1.1GHz MediaTek processor, 2 gigs of RAM, 16GB of expandable storage, 4,600mAh battery and 5MP/2MP cameras on the appropriate sides. Vodafone is selling the Smart Tab N8 on contracts starting at £16 per month for a 5GB data cap and no upfront payment. I'd sooner get exactly the same plan with Samsung's 10.1-inch Galaxy Tab A (2016), since it's been upgraded to Nougat already and waves a more alluring spec sheet, the 1,920 x 1,200 display being the most important upgrade. Hits and misses for Vodafone again, it would appear.

Hits and misses for Vodafone again, it would appear.</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>[['Jamie Rigg']]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>597b6adedf23b703bdc26cad</td>\n","      <td>56d609d1c180811310e52beb</td>\n","      <td>Apple’s Lisa Jackson to talk about the environmental and social role of tech companies at Disrupt SF</td>\n","      <td>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/18dL7NDCjvA/</td>\n","      <td>2017-07-28 15:47:41</td>\n","      <td>Apple’s Lisa Jackson to talk about the environmental and social role of tech companies at Disrupt SF  |  TechCrunch MenuSearchFollow UsFacebookInstagramTwitterYoutubeFlipboardLinkedInGoogle+RSSMoreYoutubeFlipboardLinkedInGoogle+RSSGot a tip?

Apple VP of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives Lisa Jackson knows this perfectly well as she’s responsible for making sure that Apple doesn’t make any compromise in favor of unrestrained growth. That’s why we’re excited to talk with Lisa Jackson on stage at Disrupt SF 2017 about the other side of tech.Jackson’s role at Apple encompasses so many different things. She’s the one responsible for minimizing Apple’s impact on the environment. Apple is building data centers that run 100 percent on renewable energy. But it is also concerned about the impact of its retail stores and offices.Apple also sells tens of millions of devices every quarter. The company needs to make sure that it comes in tiny packages so that it uses fewer planes, boats and trucks. And those packages are made out of paper. The company is trying to protect forests used in the production of paper packaging for Apple items.The company doesn’t want to mine the Earth until there’s no resources left. Apple is trying to use recycled material as much as possible in order to protect the Earth. And of course, Apple is trying to get back and recycle as many broken or unused devices at the end of their life cycle as possible.Apple is not perfect and it definitely feels like a work in progress, but Apple is also communicating a lot on those issues and regularly sharing updates about their various environmental projects.And protecting the Earth is just one aspect. Jackson is also trying to protect human rights and looking at Apple’s social impact. That’s why Apple stopped relying on cobalt from Congo after learning about child labor. The company is working with so many different suppliers that it needs to implement strong processes to find out if everyone is paid fairly under acceptable working conditions.Social issues aren’t limited to factories overseas. Tech companies have a responsibility when it comes to hiring and promoting a diverse pool of talent. That’s why Apple appointed its first-ever VP of Diversity and Inclusion Denise Young Smith earlier this year.And finally, Apple and other tech companies have become so big that they have a responsibility when it comes to policy changes. Everybody remembers the San Bernardino encryption case — Apple took a strong stance against the FBI and in favor of privacy.Under President Donald Trump’s administration, Silicon Valley leaders often strongly disagree with some of his decisions or tweets. It’s going to be interesting to discuss how Silicon Valley can have a say in those decisions.If you want to hear our discussion with Lisa Jackson, grab an early-bird ticket to Disrupt. You’ll also hear from Anna Fang (Zhen Fund), Adi Tatarko (Houzz), Kevin Durant (Golden State Warriors), Sebastian Thrun (Udacity) or dozens of other terrific speakers.0SHARESAdvertisementAdvertisement Newsletter SubscriptionsThe Daily CrunchGet the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inboxTC Weekly RoundupGet a weekly recap of the biggest tech storiesCrunchbase DailyThe latest startup funding announcementsEnter AddressSubscribeSEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report Jeff Bezos Becomes World's Richest Person | Crunch ReportWatch More EpisodesDisrupt SF 2017disrupt sfDisruptAppleLisa JacksonPopular Posts Featured Stories Amazon launches ‘The Hub’, parcel delivery lockers for apartment buildings17 hours ago | Ingrid Lunden It looks like Amazon would be losing a lot of money if not for AWS19 hours ago | Matthew Lynley Jeff Bezos’ brief stint as world’s richest human ends with Amazon’s second-quarter whiff20 hours ago | Matthew Lynley Apple discontinues iPod nano and shuffle and doubles iPod touch capacities to 32GB and 128GByesterday | Brian HeaterLatest From TechCrunch CocuSocial is a marketplace for affordable cooking classes13 minutes ago | Fitz Tepper Twitter tests a $99 monthly automatic Tweet promotion service26 minutes ago | Darrell Etherington Amazon gets into shoes and handbags with its new private fashion label ‘The Fix’38 minutes ago | Sarah Perez A race is underway to repair our hearing — with medicine1 hour ago | Connie Loizos Comment moderation powered by  Up NextA race is underway to repair our hearing — with medicinePosted 1 hour ago  CrunchBoardJob ListingsSoftware Engineer - Java (Contract) at Motorola Solutions (Seattle, WA, United States)Senior Android and IOS Developer (Contract) at Motorola Solutions (Seattle, WA, United States)Sr Software Engineer (Back End) at Etleap (San Francisco, CA, United States)Data Engineer at Etleap (San Francisco, CA, United States)Full Stack Developer at Laborocity (Radnor, PA, United States)More from CrunchBoardAdvertisementTechCrunchNewsVideoEventsCrunchbaseTechCrunch StoreAboutStaffContact UsAdvertise With UsEvent &amp; Editorial CalendarSend Us A TipActivations BlogInternationalChinaEuropeJapanFollow TechCrunchFacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInYoutubePinterestTumblrInstagramStumbleUponFeedTechCrunch AppsiOSAndroidWindows 8Subscribe to The Daily CrunchLatest headlines delivered to you dailySubscribe to &lt;span class=\"no-mobile\"&gt;Subscribe to &lt;/span&gt;The Daily CrunchEnter Email AddressSubscribe © 2013-2017 Oath Inc.

Named for computer science pioneer Alan Turing, the award is widely regarded as the highest distinction in Computer Science.Hellman and then-Stanford researcher Whitfield Diffie won the award for their fundamental contributions to modern cryptography. The two introduced the ideas of public-key cryptography and digital signatures, which laid the basis for most security protocols used on the Internet today.The two are integral contributors to the debate on computer and Internet privacy, and were at the forefront of what are now referred to as the first “crypto wars.” The two fought the NSA and other government agencies for the right to publish and disseminate their work to the broader public, instead of the small community of government users who wanted to keep encryption a closely guarded secret.We spoke to Professor Hellman at his home on Stanford University’s campus, discussing the work that led to the award, his fight for computer privacy and the current legal feud between Apple Computer and the Federal Bureau of Investigation over backdoors into the iOS mobile operating system.0SHARESAdvertisementAdvertisement CrunchBaseStanford University Founded1885OverviewStanford University makes a great fit for the academically driven\\rstudent.

He was just referring to the \"lock them in\" part. Right? Have something to add to this story?

By  Jo Rhett April 25, 2016Departure board at night                            (source: James Creegan via Flickr).                      This is an excerpt from Learning Puppet 4, by Jo Rhett. It may contain references to unavailable content that is part of the larger resource.The following are good practices that you should employ to take care of your Puppet servers.Indenting HeredocHeredoc format can suppress leading spaces, allowing you to maintain indentation in the code without this showing up to the user:   else {     if( $keeping_up_with_jones ) {       $message_text = @(END)         This is a bit of a rat race, don't you think $username?         All this running about, for $effort and $gain,         the results of which we can't see at all.         |- END     }   }Furthermore, you can tell Heredoc the syntax inside the block and it can validate the syntax for you. Geppetto will display it according to the appropriate syntax scheme:$certificates = @(END:json)   {     \"private_key\": \"-----RSA PRIVATE KEY----...\",     \"public_key\": \"-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----...\",     \"certificate\": \"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----...\"   }   | ENDSplaying Puppet Agent Cron JobsIf you run Puppet from cron and use Puppet or any shared data sources, you can't run them all at the same time or you will overload the data source. In situations with only a few hundred nodes, you can simply use the splay feature and the random distribution will be random enough:cron { 'puppet-agent':  ensure      =&gt; present,  environment =&gt; 'PATH=/usr/bin:/opt/puppetlabs/bin'  command     =&gt; 'puppet agent --onetime --no-daemonize --splay --splaylimit 30m\",  user        =&gt; 'root',  minute      =&gt; 0,}In my experience, after a few hundred nodes you'll find that a quarter of them end up in the same three minutes and you'll experience the \"thundering herd\" phenomenon. At that point, you'll want a mechanism to guarantee a more consistent spread of hosts.The way to do this is to have the server calculate a different minute number for each node, and add the cron resource to its catalog with that minute. The number selection must be consistent, as random numbers will change on each connection.The easiest way with zero development on your part is to use the fqdn_rand(minutes,string) function, which will always produce the same value between 0 and the minutes provided. If you don't provide a string, it will use the current node name as salt. It is possible to supply any value (which doesn't change on a node) as salt. Here are some of my favorite sources for the string:Any unique identifier for each node, such as a serial number.The node's IP address. The unique fe80:: address is always good.Node certificate name or fully qualified domain name.A unique identifier for each node from an internal datastore.It really doesn't matter how you generate the source number for the node, so long as it is evenly distributed and does not change often. However you generate the number, add 30 for the second run. Place both of these numbers in a resource like so:$minute = fqdn_rand( 30, $facts['certname'] )cron { 'puppet-agent':  ensure  =&gt; present,  command =&gt; '/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet agent --onetime --no-daemonize',  user    =&gt; 'root',  minute  =&gt; [ $minute, $minute+30 ]}Cleaning Puppet ReportsThe reports created by Puppet nodes are never removed by the server. You'll have to add jobs to clean them up. Shown here is a resource for your server to clean up reports after 90 days:cron { 'clean-puppetserver-reports':  command =&gt; 'find /var/opt/puppetlabs/puppetserver/reports -ctime +90 -delete',  user    =&gt; 'root',  minute  =&gt; '2',  hour    =&gt; '3',}While it's not likely to fill up quite so fast, the same problem does exist for the node itself. Here's a resource to apply to every node to clean up the reports once a month:cron { 'clean-puppet-agent-reports':  command =&gt; 'find /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/cache/reports -ctime +90 -delete',  user    =&gt; 'root',  day     =&gt; '1',  minute  =&gt; '2',  hour    =&gt; '3',}Adjust the timing of the runs and the retention length to meet your own needs. In many environments we centrally archive the reports on long-term storage, and delete reports older than two days on the node every night.

Announces New Space Company, Tries Pulling a Reverse Musk™Matt Novak11 minutes agoFiled to: richard bransonvirgin galacticreverse muskvirgin orbit1EditPromoteShare to KinjaToggle Conversation toolsGo to permalinkRichard Branson at a mental health conference in April 2016 (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)“I hope in five years a reusable rocket will have been developed which can take up to 10 people at a time to stay at the Virgin Hotel for two weeks,” Richard Branson proudly announced back in 1999.AdvertisementWe’re still waiting on Branson’s Virgin Galactic to take tourists into space, despite the promises of the past two decades that he would do just that. But Branson has a new idea for the meantime: Why not launch small satellites into space? Called Virgin Orbit, Branson’s newest space venture will be led by former Boeing executive Dan Hart. “By offering low cost and frequent service to space, the team is revolutionizing the small satellite market within the promising space economy,” Branson bragged on his blog.AdvertisementBranson’s space strategy, however, is a little odd, so we’ve come up with a name for it: The Reverse Musk™. How do you pull off a Reverse Musk™? You start with the really hard stuff and then give up and try the more humble projects you should’ve been working on two decades ago.Elon Musk founded SpaceX in 2002 with bold dreams of eventually propelling humans into space—to Mars and beyond. But Musk realized that you had to start with the more modest stuff. Over the next decade, SpaceX built rockets and sent capsules to the International Space Station, and launched satellites.And all of those things paid off. Musk now talks about how he wants to send space tourists around the moon by the end of 2018. And even though it’s a tremendously ambitious goal, some people believe he can do it. Why? Musk started with the “smaller” stuff like launching satellites. Getting humans to the moon and Mars may have been the ultimate goal, but Musk clearly knew that you had to learn to walk before you could run.SponsoredBranson has always been about the opposite. Yes, he’s been developing his own rockets, and spaceships—one that tragically and infamously exploded in 2014, killing a pilot. But he only recently pursued private contracts to do the more modest stuff, like launching satellites into space, that ultimately teaches lessons that you can use for manned space travel. Branson did, however, get the state of New Mexico to pay $250 million for a spaceship graveyard. So it’s not like he wasn’t busy spending other people’s money. Just not in a way that benefited very many people.AdvertisementAdvertisement“It has been my longheld dream to open access to space to change the world for good,” Branson said in a statement about his new company. “We have been striving to do that by manufacturing vehicles of the future, enabling the small satellite revolution, and preparing commercial space flight for many more humans to reach space and see our home planet.”“I’m thrilled that our small satellite launch service has now progressed to the point it merits the formation of its own company, Virgin Orbit, and a new president in Dan  with decades of deep experience and success in a broad variety of space programs.”Will Virgin Orbit be successful? Hopefully. But it’s really something he should’ve started with back in the 2000s.Advertisement“Virgin Galactic officials said 100 people already have paid $200,000 apiece to fly into space,” a story from the Associated Press in 2005 promised. “They include actress Victoria Principal, who told the news conference she looked forward to being on the first civilian flight of Virgin Galactic, perhaps as soon as 2008.”Like we said, we’re still rooting for Branson’s The Reverse Musk™, even if he has almost 20 years of failed promises in his wake. Hopefully this one takes off. Do you get it? I said, I hope this one takes off. Like the spaceships. They take off.Recommended Stories15 Years of Virgin Galactic's Failed Space Age PromisesHere Is Richard Branson Dressed as a MermaidVirgin Galactic Is Finally Back in the SkyMatt Novaknovak@gizmodo.com@paleofutureMatt Novak is the editor of Gizmodo's Paleofuture blogPGP Fingerprint: 0074 467E 1339 F416 DA8C 6CFA 0ABD A808 C05C D4A6|PGP KeyReply1 repliesLeave a replyYou may also likeJezebelWhat Is \"Birth Rape\"?9/08/10 10:15amFoxtrot AlphaVeterans Outraged At How Trump Exploited A SEAL Widow's Grief For HimselfYesterday 7:11pmKotakuThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild: The Kotaku ReviewToday 6:00amRecent from Matt Novak2014426.7KPaleofuture · Matt NovakJeff Sessions, Anti-Weed Crusader, Was a Shill For Big TobaccoYesterday 9:45am85745.4KGizmodo · Matt NovakPhotoshop Contest: Oscars Fuck-up EditionMonday 8:50am2440337.9KGizmodo · Matt NovakCrowdfunding Is the Only Way Americans Know How to Mourn After Engineer Is Killed by Terrorist2/24/17 7:50amShareTweetAbout BlogNeed Help?Content GuideGizmodo StoreRedirecting to the Gizmodo store in  Disclaimer: You are leaving a Gizmodo Media Group, LLC website and going to a third party site, which is subject to its own privacy policy and terms of use.ContinuePermissionsPrivacyTerms of UseAdvertisingJobsRSS©2017 Gizmodo Media GroupKinja is in read-only mode.

being the cause of failed drug tests is a classic urban legend that’s been floating around since a certain episode of Seinfeld. While there may be some truth behind the myth, poppy seeds aren’t likely to ruin your drug test anymore.AdvertisementIn this video from the SciShow YouTube channel, Olivia Gordon explains the science of poppy seeds, opiates, and typical drug screening tests. If you weren’t aware, morphine and other opiates come from the same plant as poppy seeds: Papaver somniferum, or the opium poppy. So, it’s possible that poppy seeds—like you’d find on a bagel or in a muffin—carry the same chemical components as the opiates drug tests typically look for. However, the truth is the trace amounts of opiates that may have ended up on those poppy seeds don’t come anywhere close to the amount in an actual dose of morphine or other hard opiates. Urine tests are pretty sensitive, and those poppy seeds from your breakfast might show up, but it won’t be enough to raise a red flag. Furthermore, the threshold for opiates found in urine was raised back in the early 2000s from .3 micrograms per milliliter to 2 micrograms per milliliter, which is a massive gap. If you’re really worried about it, avoid consuming poppy seeds for a few days before your test. But don’t sweat it if you had a tasty poppy seed muffin that morning either.The Truths Behind Eight Common \"Old Wives' Tales\"The Truths Behind Eight Common \"Old Wives' Tales\"The Truths Behind Eight Common \"Old Wives' Tales\"Whether you heard them from friends or family, you've probably heard things that sound either…Read more Read moreCan Poppy Seeds Make You Fail a Drug Test? | YouTubePatrick Allanpatrick.allan@lifehacker.com@mr_patrickallanStaff Writer, Lifehacker.comReply6 repliesLeave a replyYou may also likeThe RootConn.

         in HomeComments 136SharesShareTweetShareSaveDevindra Hardawar/AOLAmazon's been expanding its line of smart, Alexa-powered home speakers for awhile now. If you're interested in buying an Amazon Echo, well then today is your lucky day. The smart speaker, which usually is priced at $180, is on sale for just $90 at select retailers today. You can also grab an Amazon Echo Dot for $35, a $15 discount off its regular price of $50, and an Amazon Tap for $80, discounted from the regular price of $130.It's strange that these devices would be on sale at third-party stores and not Amazon itself (not only is the Echo showing as full price, but it's out of stock, with an estimated ship date of August 11. However, you can pick up a discounted device at stores such as  Bed Bath & Beyond, Best Buy and Bloomingdale's. We've seen sales on the Echo before, but this seems to be the steepest discount yet. If you want to take advantage of this offer, make sure you grab one before midnight tonight, Central time.

There was the Smart Ultra 6, which was one of the best affordable phones of its time, and the Smart Platinum 7, which was an interesting step into more expensive, sub-flagship category. But alongside those, there have been a number of humdrum handsets that failed to impress. As per its yearly update cycle, Vodafone recently released new own-brand hardware, with the Smart V8 in particular slotting into the carrier's roster as one of the best affordable options.            Gallery: Vodafone Smart V8 | 16 Photos                       16                                +12                    The most immediately striking feature of the Smart V8 when you free it from its box is the build quality. It's almost entirely brushed metal aside from two pockets of textured plastic, with neatly chamfered edges and loudspeaker grilles. While it's not pushing the boundaries of design by any means, it certainly looks and feels like it's punching above the £159 pay-as-you-go price point.The spec sheet isn't to be taken lightly either. You're looking at a 5.5-inch, 1080p LCD display, an octa-core 1.4GHz Snapdragon 435, 3 gigs of RAM, 32GB of expandable storage, a 16-megapixel primary camera and 8MP front-facer, all powered by a decent-sized 3,000mAh battery. You also get a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor and NFC chip -- hello Android Pay. Perhaps even more important, the Smart V8 is running Android 7.1.1, so it's basically as up-to-date as you can get on the software front.It's more or less the stock Android experience, albeit with a few borderline-bloatware apps from Vodafone added in. One quirk I've discovered worth noting is I can't seem to resize widgets on the homescreen. Not a huge deal, but it does mean the digital clock widget is naturally off-centre, which is slightly irritating.In sunny summer conditions, the 16MP camera can be pretty handy. Good colour saturation, clarity, and contrast thanks to the HDR mode. The app is pretty busy with filters and features and settings, from full manual control to long exposure and \"active photo\" modes (kinda like GIFs/Live Photos). You won't find much help in them in low-light conditions, though, where the camera begins to fall off fairly quickly.             Gallery: Vodafone Smart V8 camera samples | 13 Photos                       13                                +9                    All in all, there's nothing particularly special about the Smart V8. These days, metalwork, this kind of spec sheet and value-added features like fingerprint sensor and NFC are becoming standard at the mid-to-low end. The new handset does have something going for it, though -- a pretty competitive price tag.Vodafone's pay-as-you-go range is relatively sparse around the £150 mark. You've got the £149 Sony Xperia L1, which is less attractive enough on paper to justify the jump to the £159 Smart V8. The closest handset beyond that point is the fairly comparable £199 Huawei P8 lite (2017). The Moto G5 gets a nod too, obviously, as well as the Wileyfox Swift 2, since they can be bought elsewhere for bang on £159. You wouldn't say either of them are significantly better than the Smart V8, though.Smart N8If you've set yourself a slightly tighter budget, Vodafone also recently launched the Smart N8, an £85 handset sitting in the crowded low-end of the pay-as-you-go spectrum. It's more than appropriately specced, with a 5-inch, 720p display, quad-core 1.3GHz MediaTek chip, 1.5GB of RAM, 16 gigs of expandable storage, 13- and 5-megapixel cameras, fingerprint sensor, NFC and 2,400mAh battery.Despite looking a little on the drab side, it's a decent value device. You could always save yourself a London pint and opt for the £79 Moto G4 Play instead, which recently began receiving Android Nougat, but you would be sacrificing the fingerprint reader/NFC combo. But that's true of most other devices dipping below the £100 marker at the moment.Smart Tab N8While the two smartphones have obvious places in Vodafone's backroom, the new Smart Tab N8 is where things get confusing. The draw of pretty much all own-brand tablets is ultimate portability, thanks to 4G, at a reasonable cost. I wouldn't call the Smart Tab N8 very portable though, because it's massive. It's not that heavy at 465g and it's pretty thin, too, with 8.95mm between the glass front and textured, tactile plastic back -- it's that it's all face.             Gallery: Vodafone Smart Tab N8 | 9 Photos                       9                                +5                    Not only does the slate carry a 10.1-inch display, but a significant bloating of bezel around it. It's not something you could slip into a handbag and it not be a nuisance, let's say. Worse yet, that 10.1-inch screen runs at a very noticeable 1,280 x 800 resolution, making it easy to pick out individual pixels. Large tablets are typically geared more towards entertainment, but 149 ppi doesn't really cut it nowadays.The other specs are largely irrelevant: A quad-core 1.1GHz MediaTek processor, 2 gigs of RAM, 16GB of expandable storage, 4,600mAh battery and 5MP/2MP cameras on the appropriate sides. Vodafone is selling the Smart Tab N8 on contracts starting at £16 per month for a 5GB data cap and no upfront payment. I'd sooner get exactly the same plan with Samsung's 10.1-inch Galaxy Tab A (2016), since it's been upgraded to Nougat already and waves a more alluring spec sheet, the 1,920 x 1,200 display being the most important upgrade. Hits and misses for Vodafone again, it would appear.

Apple VP of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives Lisa Jackson knows this perfectly well as she’s responsible for making sure that Apple doesn’t make any compromise in favor of unrestrained growth. That’s why we’re excited to talk with Lisa Jackson on stage at Disrupt SF 2017 about the other side of tech.Jackson’s role at Apple encompasses so many different things. She’s the one responsible for minimizing Apple’s impact on the environment. Apple is building data centers that run 100 percent on renewable energy. But it is also concerned about the impact of its retail stores and offices.Apple also sells tens of millions of devices every quarter. The company needs to make sure that it comes in tiny packages so that it uses fewer planes, boats and trucks. And those packages are made out of paper. The company is trying to protect forests used in the production of paper packaging for Apple items.The company doesn’t want to mine the Earth until there’s no resources left. Apple is trying to use recycled material as much as possible in order to protect the Earth. And of course, Apple is trying to get back and recycle as many broken or unused devices at the end of their life cycle as possible.Apple is not perfect and it definitely feels like a work in progress, but Apple is also communicating a lot on those issues and regularly sharing updates about their various environmental projects.And protecting the Earth is just one aspect. Jackson is also trying to protect human rights and looking at Apple’s social impact. That’s why Apple stopped relying on cobalt from Congo after learning about child labor. The company is working with so many different suppliers that it needs to implement strong processes to find out if everyone is paid fairly under acceptable working conditions.Social issues aren’t limited to factories overseas. Tech companies have a responsibility when it comes to hiring and promoting a diverse pool of talent. That’s why Apple appointed its first-ever VP of Diversity and Inclusion Denise Young Smith earlier this year.And finally, Apple and other tech companies have become so big that they have a responsibility when it comes to policy changes. Everybody remembers the San Bernardino encryption case — Apple took a strong stance against the FBI and in favor of privacy.Under President Donald Trump’s administration, Silicon Valley leaders often strongly disagree with some of his decisions or tweets. It’s going to be interesting to discuss how Silicon Valley can have a say in those decisions.If you want to hear our discussion with Lisa Jackson, grab an early-bird ticket to Disrupt.

Image: Chomp EaterySan Francisco is a city of long lines, and on a Saturday afternoon few lines here are longer than the one in front of the Chocolate Chair in Japantown. The Chocolate Chair’s specialty is Dragon’s Breath, neon-colored balls of puffed rice cereal soaked in liquid nitrogen. When you take a bite, the nitrogen-infusion fills your mouth with a dense, smoke-like gas. Breathe the gas out through your nose or mouth, and voilà, man becomes dragon.AdvertisementIts popularity is not due to its taste. Dragon’s Breath is, in fact, kind of disgusting. When fresh, it tastes kind of like fruit loops, but most of the time Dragon’s Breath is served stale, its taste more reminiscent of cardboard. The appeal comes instead from its aesthetics. Walk by its corner of the mall on any given day and you’ll find it surrounded by throngs of smartphone photographers. It is the food that launched a thousand Instagrams.With the right aesthetic, food can now go viral: Dragon’s Breath, ice cream logs, the rainbow grilled cheese, the raindrop cake. These foods are designed to be filtered. In the age of Instagram, the way food looks is more important than how it tastes.AdvertisementThe Chocolate Chair is a typical viral food success story. It got its start selling ice cream made with liquid nitrogen a few years ago before its L.A. outlet debuted Dragon’s Breath last spring. Thanks to a catchy name and visual effects, thousands of Instagram posts and a flurry of press coverage followed. No one said it was good, but it didn’t matter. Because damn does it make for a good Instagram selfie.Makeup looks are now designed to look better on Instagram than they do IRL. The same thing is happening to our food.AdvertisementSponsoredRainbow grilled cheese topped with sprinkles swept our social media feeds this year, but the idea of actually eating it is mildly nauseating. Black Tap Burger & Beer in New York famously serves a gut-buster milkshake with toppings such as a whole slice of cake, but more people want to take a photo with it than finish it. The Raindrop Cake, made to look like a beautiful over-sized bead of water, reportedly tastes like literally nothing.In the age of Instagram, the way food looks is more important than how it tastes.And yet, there are thousands of posts, dozens of hashtags devoted to these foods and countless fawning news stories devoted to these foods. Black Tap’s milkshakes rocketed it from an unknown NYC burger joint to bi-coastal acclaim. The Raindrop Cake, a weekend pop-up started by an advertising guy, has been so successful that its creator recently quit his day job to focus on making tasteless gelatinous cakes full-time.“Food has become an accessible status symbol,” said food futurist Anna Griggs.AdvertisementOver the last year or two, she told me, she’s noticed a significant uptick in foods that are popular for reasons besides taste. “It’s something that we’ve been seeing across categories—in food, fashion, makeup. It’s the popularization of these looks that are just designed to be photographed for Instagram,” she said. “People will wait in line for hours just to get a photo of a Black Tap milkshake. You put in the time and effort to wait in line and get the shot. And then people want the validation of the likes and comments.”“Food has become an accessible status symbol.” Pretty food, of course, is not new. Throughout history—and especially among the upper crust—certain dishes have proven popular mainly because of their elaborate presentations. In the 19th Century, Mrs. Beeton’s Book of Household Management suggested that the Victorian middle class arrange their salads to look like elaborate cakes. The Victorians were also obsessed with jellies, a gastronomic craze more about wobbling, high-stacked spectacle than taste.Victorian salad arrangement advice.

Back in 2014, the New York Times food critic Pete Wells coined this “camera cuisine,” noting that at high-end eateries in particular, its rise seemed intrinsically linked to a decline in taste.AdvertisementAdvertisement“A side effect of the digital age in food photography, camera cuisine is any dish that was inspired by a picture or aspires to be one,” he wrote. “Like any genre of cooking, camera cuisine varies widely in quality, but in its purest form it is both exquisitely photogenic and peculiarly bland and lifeless.”What’s new, Griggs told me, is that this obsession with a meal’s aesthetics has now filtered into mass culture. The fixation has in turn prompted purveyors of food to cater to Instagram’s foodie set. At the top of its menu, New York City’s Empellón include a message noting that “Empellón strongly discourages the use of cellphones, unless you’re posting food porn on Instagram. #Empellon.” Several times, I’ve seen restaurant chefs spot a food-photographing diner and pull them into a spot with better lighting and restaurants now dole out free meals to Instagram “influencers” for a shot at going viral. A New York Times review can still make or break a restaurant, but now so can Instagram.Remember when Martha Stewart tweeted a photo of a wedge salad she had made and was immediately shamed by Twitter for its less than desirable aesthetic?Griggs recounted for me her experience with rolled ice cream as evidence.AdvertisementAdvertisement“I loved watching it being made, and then I was just so disappointed,” she said. “I would have been so much happier with an ice cream cone.”Already, the pretty-food movement has inspired satire and ridicule. This summer, Ikea ran a popular ad campaign mocking Instagramming your food by imagining how it would have ruined 18th century meals. Man Repeller spoofed Instagram food porn by going on the “Instagram Foodie Diet” for a day, and then barfing. The truth is, ugly food is still delicious and the rise of pretty, gross food has begun to spur a divergent ugly food movement. The subreddit “Shitty Food Porn” collects images of food people are eating that they would only share with the anonymous internet.AdvertisementMaybe it’s okay, though, to value food more for how it looks than how it tastes.Darren Wong, the proprietor of the Raindrop Cake, rejects the premise that food even needs to be about taste. His Raindrop Cake, made from a gelatin-like substance called agar, was inspired by mizu shingen mochi, a Japanese dessert he discovered online.“The cake itself is really about texture,” he told me. “For most people with an American palate, taste is the most important thing. But in many Asian dishes, the dish is really built around texture. I didn’t approach this as a food item. I approached it as an experience. It doesn’t matter what it tastes like.”AdvertisementAdvertisementWong went to Japan and studied the dessert, then spent months trying to create a cake that almost perfectly resembled an oversized raindrop, a cake that would be like eating water. He debuted it at Smorgasborg in Brooklyn last March to much acclaim. Wong credits social media, and in particular Instagram, almost entirely for its success.Food, though, has always been about more than just the taste of what we put in how mouths. We also value the atmosphere of a restaurant, or the company of family and friends. Maybe Instagram has just shown us another way to enjoy food—taking in not just how it looks, but the social media conversation those aesthetics spur.“I did think a lot about visuals when I launched it,” Wong told me. “The majority of my customers, the first thing they do before taking a bite is take a photo.”Kristen V.

Indeed, while he’s not sure how much he can do to help Cloudflare, which has a Boston office, a bill that Senator Lesser helped craft will be heard in committee next Tuesday, and it would put a serious crimp in what he calls “shakedown operations” more broadly.More from a conversation we had this morning, edited for length:TC: You’re on the young side to be a state senator.EL: I’d gone to Harvard, then Harvard Law School, and in my third year, I decided to jump into a race in the community where I grew up, and I won. It was a five-way primary, and very close. I think I won by 192 votes out of around 17,000. [Laughs.]TC: When did you zero in on this patent problem?EL: In Massachusetts, you serve two-year terms, and after I was reelected to my second term, a friend who I was friendly with in college was at HBS and he sort of said, “There’s this thing that’s starting to create real issues,” and it was patent trolling. I’d had a very atmospheric knowledge of it from law school and IP classes, but I began realizing this was a very big deal.TC: How did you get started on your related work?EL: My friend first connected me with Eric Paley of [the venture firm] Founder Collective, and his wife, Shirley, who’s an IP lawyer and so knows this stuff well. Turns out there was a bill in Massachusetts that had been hanging around a while, authored by Anthony Petruccelli, who was a state senator who has since taken a job in the private sector. So we picked it up last year and attached it to an economic development bill, and the response to it was overwhelming.TC: But you didn’t get it through your state’s legislature.EL: We didn’t. So we reached out to the tech and legal community to better understand the ins and outs of what we wanted to propose, and we crafted a new bill — the one that will be heard on Tuesday [by the Joint Committee on Consumer Protection and Professional Licensure].It’s just the second or third inning of this process. The bills — and there are two other patent bills, as well — will be heard on Tuesday. After that, the committee will begin the process of analyzing them and providing recommendations. Then they’re off, potentially, to the floor of both the House and the Senate.TC: When? In the fall? Early next year?EL: It’s hard to tell when that would happen. But everyone is up for reelection in November 2018, so before then, because the whole process starts anew afterward, with a new Senate and House that comes in.TC: Yikes. Is it good news or bad for you that there are two bills dealing with patent trolls?EL: It’s good. It’s a level of the indication of interest and hopefully shows that a lot of members of legislature are involved in this. It also helps create buzz and momentum.I think all of us understand that there is a need to strongly protect intellectual property and show zero tolerance for anyone copying IP. But what we’re seeing is a really vicious and cyclical process where, for profit, people are bullying and scaring young entrepreneurs. You hear about the three or four kids in a dorm room who are tinkering around with an idea, then suddenly, they get slammed with one of these completely vague cease-and-desist letters from a place they’ve never heard of, citing patents they didn’t know existed. The threat is: turn over everything you’re doing to us, or pay us $30,000.TC: Cloudflare is particularly concerned with the growth of non-practicing entities that are started by former IP litigators, because they can buy up unused patents on the cheap, then, using their law degrees, easily and affordably put the screws to companies with those patents. Are you trying to outlaw these firms specifically?EL: It’s a little further afield from where we are today, but not entirely. The way we’ve delineated it is, if you’re involved in R&D or manufacturing or you’re a hospital or a university or a business — basically, if you a real entity — then this bill is likely not going to apply to you.We’re trying with some specificity to zero in on these non-practicing entities, so it would include the [Cloudflare] situation and other patent trolls that we’re observing more and more. These firms raise funding, as would a startup or venture firm, then they use that money to vacuum up a bunch of patents for the sole purpose of suing other companies. That’s bad for the economy, bad for innovation, and frankly, a loophole — a kink — that needs to be resolved.TC: It looks like Anthony Petruccelli was a state senator for nine years. I guess you don’t have term limits in Massachusetts? Do you see yourself staying put for a while?EL: Unlike in California [where you are], we have no term limits here. And yes, I’m [really dedicated to the issue].The tech community hasn’t been engaged in public policy, and for a variety of reasons, you now see the entrepreneurship community and the VC community — especially at the state level — start to really step up and talk about why these protections are important. So we’re really focused on it.There’s inaction on the federal level and complete dysfunction in Congress. Patents and IP have traditionally been the province of the federal government. But for states like California and Massachusetts, this is too important a part of our economy and job creation to wait for the government to get involved.TC: Is there a state that you’ve used in creating your bill, one that you think is getting it right when it comes to patent trolls?EL: There are 33 states with some version of this legislation, so it’s not a brand new idea. It’s been tested in lots of places, with varying degrees of strictness. Given how important startups and venture capital are to Massachusetts, it’s a little embarrassing that we don’t have similar legislation already.0SHARESAdvertisementAdvertisement CrunchbaseCloudflare Founded2009OverviewCloudflare is a web performance and security company that provides online services to protect and accelerate websites online.\\r\\r\\rThe company’s online platforms include Cloudflare CDN, which distributes content around the world to speed up websites; Cloudflare optimizer that enables web pages with ad servers and third-party widgets to download Snappy software on mobiles and computers; CloudFlare …LocationSan Francisco, CACategoriesSecurity, Web Hosting, Advertising, Analytics, Ad Server, Enterprise Software FoundersMichelle ZatlynWebsitehttp://www.cloudflare.com Full profile for Cloudflare Newsletter SubscriptionsThe Daily CrunchGet the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inboxTC Weekly RoundupGet a weekly recap of the biggest tech storiesCrunchbase DailyThe latest startup funding announcementsEnter AddressSubscribeSEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report DraftKings and FanDuel No Longer Merging | Crunch ReportWatch More Episodescloudflarepatent trollsGovernmentPopular Posts Featured Stories Uber acqui-hires social app studio Swipe Labs6 hours ago | Josh Constine Vertu is dead16 hours ago | John Biggs, Steve O'Hear Here’s a sneak peek of what Disney’s Star Wars Land will look like20 hours ago | Greg Kumparak Jefferies gives IBM Watson a Wall Street reality checkyesterday | John MannesLatest From TechCrunch Is Amazon working on a new messaging app called Anytime?48 minutes ago | Ingrid Lunden Microsoft’s Path Guide is an unconventional approach to indoor navigation1 hour ago | Devin Coldewey Scout It Out is a New York marketplace for arts spaces2 hours ago | Jonathan Shieber Light starts shipping the L16, its 16-camera pocket DSLR challenger2 hours ago | Darrell Etherington Comment moderation powered by  Up NextMicrosoft’s Path Guide is an unconventional approach to indoor navigationPosted 1 hour ago  CrunchBoardJob ListingsiOS Developer at Badoo (London, United Kingdom)UI Engineer @ Athos at Athos (Redwood City, CA, United States)Designer at Flocabulary (Brooklyn, NY, United States)Data Engineer at Flocabulary (Brooklyn, NY, United States)Senior Software Engineer at Flocabulary (Brooklyn, NY, United States)More from CrunchBoardAdvertisementTechCrunchNewsVideoEventsCrunchbaseTechCrunch StoreAboutStaffContact UsAdvertise With UsEvent & Editorial CalendarSend Us A TipActivations BlogInternationalChinaEuropeJapanFollow TechCrunchFacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInYoutubePinterestTumblrInstagramStumbleUponFeedTechCrunch AppsiOSAndroidWindows 8Subscribe to The Daily CrunchLatest headlines delivered to you dailySubscribe to <span class=\"no-mobile\">Subscribe to </span>The Daily CrunchEnter Email AddressSubscribe © 2013-2017 Oath Inc.

John Lewis' Graphic Novel Skyrockets After Trump Twitter StormBeth ElderkinToday 11:30amFiled to: comicsgraphic noveljohn lewisdonald trumpmarch2929EditPromoteShare to KinjaToggle Conversation toolsGo to permalinkCredit: Top Shelf ProductionsThree years ago, Representative John Lewis published the first book in a three-part graphic novel series about his experience as a leader for the Civil Rights Movement. Today, March is one of the biggest books in the country, selling out on Amazon overnight. And it’s all because the next president decided to pick a fight. Earlier this week, the Georgia congressman announced that he would not be attending President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. He added that he doubts the legitimacy of Trump’s election, given recent revelations about Russia’s attempts to sway public opinion in Trump’s favor. Doubting a presidency isn’t something Trump is unfamiliar with, given his years of claiming President Barack Obama wasn’t born here. However, instead of agreeing to disagree, Trump attacked the congressman’s credibility on Twitter...on a weekend celebrating the Civil Rights Movement Lewis fought and nearly died for.Rep.

So it’s no surprise that his completed graphic novel memoir, March, soared 106,700-percent in sales on Amazon. It’s currently the number-one book on the site, up from #237, and it’s sold out. The individual books in the graphic novel series, which are still available, have likewise surged in sales. Amazon is also sold out of Rep. Lewis’ biography, Walking With The Wind. March, co-written by Andrew Aydin and illustrated by Nate Powell, dives into Lewis’ upbringing during Jim Crow-era segregation and goes through his civil rights advocacy into the first March From Selma To Montgomery, which marked its 50th anniversary in 2015. It was a New York Times bestseller and the first graphic novel to receive a National Book Award, and there are plans to possibly turn it into an animated series.AdvertisementAdvertisement[Mediate]Recommended StoriesJohn Lewis' Acclaimed Graphic Novel March Is Becoming an Animated SeriesHouse Democrats Hold Sit-in to Demand Gun Control VoteCivil Rights Graphic Novel March: Book 3 Is the First Comic Book to Win a National Book AwardGear from Kinja DealsBestsellers: Lord of the Rings: The Extended Motion Picture TrilogyBestsellers: HGST Touro S 1TB 7200RPM Portable DriveSunday's Best Deals: Pepsi 1893, Fitbits, TriggerPoint Foam Rollers, and MoreReply29 repliesLeave a replyYou may also likeio9NBC's Powerless Breaks the Canon With a Stupid Wayne CousinYesterday 2:00pmio9Proof That the Creators of Batman: The Animated Series Knew What They Were Doing From the StartFriday 4:00pmio9Please Let the Hook For Marvel's Defenders Series Be Daredevil's Giant Literal Plot HoleThursday 1:15pmRecent from Beth Elderkin1153.4Kio9 · Beth ElderkinHBO Holds Game of Thrones Season 8 Renewal in Hopes of More Episodes45 minutes ago7273.6Kio9 · Beth ElderkinJames Cameron Making Docu-Series About Evolution of Science FictionToday 10:15am112812.3Kio9 · Beth ElderkinIt's Okay, Penguin, Daddy's BackYesterday 4:30pmShareTweetAbout BlogNeed Help?Content GuideGizmodo StoreRedirecting to the Gizmodo store in  Disclaimer: You are leaving a Gizmodo Media Group, LLC website and going to a third party site, which is subject to its own privacy policy and terms of use.ContinuePermissionsPrivacyTerms of UseAdvertisingJobsRSS©2017 Gizmodo Media GroupKinja is in read-only mode.

Rob LeFebvre, @roblef       8m ago              in TransportationComments 5SharesShareTweetShareSaveNathan Ingraham/EngadgetLast month, a Senate committee created a proposal to allow autonomous vehicles onto the roads under specific safety and \"tech neutral\" requirements. Now that the bill has hit House of Representatives, the bipartisan Energy and Commerce Committee voted to send it along to the full chamber. The Safely Ensuring Lives Future Deployment and Research In Vehicle Evolution Act, or SELF DRIVE, is aimed at allowing companies like Uber and Google to test up to 100,000 autonomous vehicles across the country. While we're far from an actual bill, this seems like good forward movement.If driverless cars are ever going to gain a foothold on the road, they'll need to be as safe as (or safer that) current automobiles are. Companies like Lyft, GM and Toyota have been lobbying for this type of legislation for a while now. The Department of Transportation will need to ensure this if it wants to exempt the vehicles from federal rules that govern current cars, like the requirement they have steering wheels, for example. The proposed bill, which isn't yet scheduled for full House consideration, also bars states from setting their own possibly conflicting regulations around the design, operation and software components of self-driving cars. States will be able to restrict autonomous vehicles on public roads in some way, according to ReCode.

Instead of entering a username and password as the only line of defense to our computer systems, it wants us to rely on other data that comes from the phone in our pockets.That smartphone has a number of sensors in it like an accelerometer and a GPS, and using the kinds of data it gather from the phone, the company can begin to build an understanding of who you are, your typical behaviors and even the cadence of how you walk. It pulls this information into a machine learning back-end to process it and build a profile of each individual in the system.The username and password doesn’t go away completely with this technique, but it becomes a secondary form of authentication when the system lacks a high enough probability that it is a given person.You could understand how an approach like that would be attractive to any number of companies and governments, all of which are desperately looking for better ways to secure their systems. It was that same creative thinking that got the company into the TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield in San Francisco last year, where it placed second, and it is the same reasoning that attracts investors.Today, the company announced a $20 million Series A investment led by NEA with participation from Andreessen Horowitz, Stanford-StartX and Accomplice Ventures, each of which had participated in the company’s seed round.When it launched at the Battlefield competition last fall, the company announced a consumer-focused Chrome browser plug-in with an iOS app. Today, it has changed focus, offering a Software Development Kit (SDK) to customers to install their authentication tools as a service inside any application.“The business model is to sell the SDK and backend platform to companies with pre existing mobile apps and charge on a per-API call basis,” co-founder Kurt Somerville told TechCrunch.It’s similar to how a company would add payment services to an application using Stripe or communications services using Twilio.Once the UnifyID tools are in place, a user could simply walk up to their computer, and without signing in, start working because the system would understand based on the UnifyID information that it was that person. In turn, when the person walked away from the machine, it would deactivate it so that nobody else could use the computer.Somerville says the company has done accuracy tests to ensure the validity of the system and claims they have found it to be accurate 99.99 percent of the time.Today, the company is working with 10 business partners on the SDK, and has 15 full time employees, but with $20 million in new money, they are shooting to have around 40 engineers in next 6-9 months. “It’s aggressive scale and we feel we need to do it to be able to work with companies that are showing interest in our platform,” Somerville explained.0SHARESAdvertisementAdvertisement Newsletter SubscriptionsThe Daily CrunchGet the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inboxTC Weekly RoundupGet a weekly recap of the biggest tech storiesCrunchbase DailyThe latest startup funding announcementsEnter AddressSubscribeSEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report Reddit Now Valued at $1.8 Billion | Crunch ReportWatch More EpisodesStartup Battlefieldmulti-factor authenticationauthenticationDeveloperPopular Posts Featured Stories Sling Studio Makes Multi-Camera Video Production So Damn Easy.VIDEO | 5:21 | Gadgets Several departures at venture firm Kleiner Perkins12 hours ago | Katie Roof Spotify preps to go public with 60M subscribers, outpacing Apple17 hours ago | Josh Constine, Katie Roof HBO got hacked and some Game of Thrones materials are bubbling up online18 hours ago | Taylor Hatmaker HomePod firmware reveals iPhone 8 design and facial recognition23 hours ago | Romain DilletLatest From Startups Sofia Vergara wants to empower women with Eby, a new subscription underwear service23 minutes ago | Jordan Crook Boxed is trying to predict when you’ll run out of snacks and toilet paper1 hour ago | Anthony Ha Carspring, a London and Berlin startup that lets you buy a used car online, raises £5M Series B4 hours ago | Steve O'Hear New border wall bill draws on Palmer Luckey’s new defense company10 hours ago | Taylor Hatmaker Comment moderation powered by  Up NextBoxed is trying to predict when you’ll run out of snacks and toilet paperPosted 1 hour ago  CrunchBoardJob ListingsSenior Systems Architect Lead Developers @  Bolt Threads at Bolt Threads (San Francisco, CA, United States)Principal Engineer, Software Operations @ Bolt Threads at Bolt Threads (Emeryville, CA, United States)Software Engineer - Java (Contract) at Motorola Solutions (Seattle, WA, United States)Senior Android and IOS Developer (Contract) at Motorola Solutions (Seattle, WA, United States)Sr Software Engineer (Back End) at Etleap (San Francisco, CA, United States)More from CrunchBoardAdvertisementTechCrunchNewsVideoEventsCrunchbaseTechCrunch StoreAboutStaffContact UsAdvertise With UsEvent & Editorial CalendarSend Us A TipActivations BlogInternationalChinaEuropeJapanFollow TechCrunchFacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInYoutubePinterestTumblrInstagramStumbleUponFeedTechCrunch AppsiOSAndroidWindows 8Subscribe to The Daily CrunchLatest headlines delivered to you dailySubscribe to <span class=\"no-mobile\">Subscribe to </span>The Daily CrunchEnter Email AddressSubscribe © 2013-2017 Oath Inc.

Wherever it is, it’s the home of Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) and his family.As Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) and his Death Troopers march towards Erso and his homestead, Galen tells his daughter Jyn, “Whatever I do, I do it to protect you. Say you understand,” he intones, as we get a good look at the young Jyn.

Stylish and practical!As Krennic sets his eyes on the young Jyn hiding in the grass, we smash-cut to the present—with Jyn (now played by Felicity Jones) in an Imperial detention facility. It’s cut to make it look like Jyn is waking up from dreaming about her past, but either way, this is definitely from early on in the film.GIF Jyn is busted out of captivity by some Rebels.

Krennic stands defiantly against the Dark Lord, reveling in the power of his new battlestation...GIF ...which gets another good money shot. Seriously, all these trailers have basically been Death Star porn.The Rebels, however, are less impressed and more petrified. “If the Empire has this kind of power,” a sympathizer intones over a hologram of the Death Star, “what chance do we have?”GIF As if to make her point, we cut to Jedha, where a big fight has broken out—and the Empire are just slaughtering people left, right, and center. Presumably this is not during Jyn’s breakout, as she’s with Cassian this time around.GIF A short shot of Clone Wars veteran Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker)a nd his robot leg is played under Jyn’s simple retort. “We have hope.

That hope he and Jyn keeping referencing can make “10 men feel like a hundred,” according to Cassian.GIF We get a few more shots of X-Wings and Y-Wings battling in a dark canyon, an extended look at a scene from the last trailer. It’s hard to tell if this is simply Jedha at night or a different planet. We know there’s at least one other big location, a planet called Eadu (thanks to Jyn’s action figure designating her appearance as being on that planet).

X-Wings launch an attack on a facility (which looks like it’s in orbit above Scarif, considering the amount of water on the planet below). It’s not the Death Star, but some kind of other Imperial station.Jyn calls out the Alliance operatives on Yavin. “You’re all rebels, aren’t you?” This is the most optimism we’ve seen from Rogue One, which previously was very doom and gloom about our heroes’ chances.GIF A massive explosion tears apart the surface of Jedha while a figure looks on—the goggles and hair make it look like it’s Bohdi. This looks like part of a sequence we saw in the last trailer of Cassian and Jyn’s U-Wing fleeing a huge blast.

George Federal Courthouse                                    Getty ImagesJust a couple of days after the FBI arrested Marcus Hutchins (aka MalwareTech) he made an appearance in a Las Vegas federal courthouse, pleading not guilty to charges accusing him of creating the Kronos banking malware. KSNV News 3 Las Vegas reporter Christy Wilcox reported from the scene, tweeting that prosecutors claim Hutchins admitted to writing malware code (presumably for the Kronos banking malware) as well as playing a role in its sale and distribution.An update on @MalwareTechBlog and some clarification on misreported facts. pic.twitter.com/6CHlexapoE— Andrew Mabbitt (@MabbsSec) August 5, 2017Fidus Information Security co-founder Andrew Mabbitt has spoken out in his defense and tried to clear up some apparent misinformation about the 23-year-old hacker's stay in Las Vegas during Def Con. While some reports have focused on the pricey Airbnb mansion where Hutchins stayed and the rented supercars he was driving, Mabbitt says that the stay in the villa was free, and someone else paid to rent the Corvette and Lamborghini he tweeted about.The prosecutors apparently also cited tweets from the past week where Hutchins fired guns (legally) at a local range as a reason why he should not be granted bail. His lawyer Adrian Lobo called that claim \"garbage\" while telling reporters outside the courthouse that the judge determined he is not a flight risk said he would be released once certain conditions are met. Those include raising $30,000 for bail, and reportedly he will be banned from internet access or contact with his unnamed co-defendant. Unfortunately, because the clerk's office closed at 4 PM that has not happened yet. The attorney expects he will be released on Monday, but he will need to appear in Wisconsin to face the grand jury indictment there.Marcus Hutchins has been regarded worldwide as a hero due to his actions during the recent WannaCry outbreak, and Andrew Mabbitt says that as soon as tomorrow there will be a crowdfunding campaign starting to help raise funds for his legal defense.

SomethingEve Peyser47 minutes agoFiled to: facebook liveabortioncatholicismpriestgizmodo nightsinternet jailanti-choicepro-life241EditPromoteDismissUndismissHideShare to KinjaToggle Conversation toolsGo to permalinkScreenshot via FacebookFather Frank Pavone, who calls himself “one of the most prominent pro-life leaders in the world,” streamed some questionable content on Facebook Live on Sunday in the name of Donald Trump or something.AdvertisementThe priest, once granted the “Proudly Pro-life Award” from the National Right to Life Committee, streamed a sermon in anticipation of the election standing before (in his own words) “a child who was killed by abortion and entrusted to us by a pathologist for burial.”“Today I am doing something rather extraordinary,” Pavone says, gazing into the camera to commence the 44-minute live stream. Advertisement“We are going to pray with this baby and we are going to let this baby’s body bear witness to our nation as we begin the process to elect our next president,” the priest continues, inanely listing off various levels of government.Ravone calmly presents the viewer with “a very simple choice.” To either “elect those who are going to affirm the covenant we have with God or those who reject it.” Donald Trump is perhaps closer to God than his opponent considering he presumably grabbed his covenant right by the pussy.“The testimony of scripture and the testimony of the life of this child point to the critical importance of this election,” the priest explains. He urges viewers—of which there were over 250,000—to choose life. In the description of the video, he asserts that voting for Donald Trump and Republicans in general means you’re voting to protect children.SponsoredWill a Facebook Live stream of a priest with a dead baby convince people to vote for Trump? Hard to say. Is Frank’s dead fetus real? Is it even allowed on Facebook? Should it be? In September, the company took down a Pulitzer-winning photograph of a naked Vietnamese girl covered in Napalm. Facebook then reversed its initial decision and reinstated the photo, giving the following statement:After hearing from our community, we looked again at how our Community Standards were applied in this case. An image of a naked child would normally be presumed to violate our Community Standards, and in some countries might even qualify as child pornography. In this case, we recognize the history and global importance of this image in documenting a particular moment in time.We have reached out to Facebook to ask if Pavone’s content is allowed on the platform and will update the post if we get a response.AdvertisementAdvertisementAccording Facebook’s community standards, the company removes “graphic images when they are shared for sadistic pleasure or to celebrate or glorify violence.” So I guess it depends if the priest live streamed this dead fetus for “sadistic pleasure.” One could make a pretty compelling case for that.Here’s the whole (very disturbing) Facebook Live stream:[Washington Post]Eve Peysereve@gizmodo.com@evepeyserEve Peyser is the night editor at Gizmodo.Facebook livEFacebook Admits Pulitzer-Winning Photograph Is Not Child PornographyFacebook Still Says It's Not a Media Company, Announces Election Day CoverageFormer Facebook Workers: We Routinely Suppressed Conservative NewsGear from Kinja DealsUmbra's Twilight Rod Takes Your Curtains from the Windows to the WallBestsellers: HGST Touro S 1TB 7200RPM Portable DriveSave $20 on One of the Only Inkjet Printers You Should Consider BuyingReply24 repliesLeave a replyYou may also likeThe BestsThe Best Strategy Games On PCToday 7:00pmSploidInteractive Periodic Table Reveals Exactly How We Use All Those ElementsToday 10:28amThe ConcourseThe Entire Plot Of The Next Season Of Game Of Thrones Seems To Have LeakedToday 12:15pmRecent from Eve Peyser37Eve Peyser · Eve PeyserElection?

Cast Has Trouble Explaining Legion in a New VideoKatharine TrendacostaToday 4:45pmFiled to: legionfxx-mentelevision16EditPromoteShare to KinjaToggle Conversation toolsGo to permalinkGIF Image: Legion, FXLegion is a TV show that is so out there and complicated that its cast isn’t quite sure how to describe it. Thankfully, executive producer Noah Hawley seems to know what’s going on, even if no one else does.AdvertisementFX’s new first look video at Legion gives us the most comprehensive look yet at this new series, and it looks amazing, weird, and eclectic. In the video, after the cast makes jokes about how they don’t know anything, Hawley also gives the best description of the series we’ve seen yet, saying, “This is a show about a man named David Haller, who has been diagnosed as a schizophrenic and has spent the last five years in a psychiatric institution. He begins to get the sense that he may not be crazy, that he may have these abilities.”There’s a lot of footage in this video, with a lot of unusual angles and color. The show promises a lot of questions about what is real and what is only in David’s head. Given how orange the almost-certainly-a-delusion dance sequence is, I wonder if color is going to help us sort out the real from the fake in this series. There’s also a bit of a scene that we’ve previously glimpsed in the trailers. It shows David using his powers in what looks like an escape attempt from a bunker. GIF This feels pretty squarely in the X-Men realm and, if I were a betting person, looks like David leading a bunch of mutants away from somewhere. It’s not the glass house overlooking things that we seen Jean Smart’s character, Melanie Bird, lecture David in. But it does look like a similar forest.AdvertisementThat said, this is just speculation since “David Haller is a mutant and has trouble with reality” is pretty much all we officially know about this show.Legion premieres on FX on February 8.

We saw it get as low as $550, but the nearly identical UN55KU6290 is now on sale for just $500.AdvertisementThe only difference, so far as I can tell,  is the UN55KU6290 doesn’t have a Smart Remote. If you can live without that, you’d be hard pressed to find a better picture for this price.Recommended StoriesToday's Best Deals: KitchenAid Mixers, IZOD, Vinyl Printer, Mechanical Keyboard, and MoreFinally Try Out a Clicky Mechanical Keyboard For Just $27If You Don't Have One Already, Here's a PS4 Slim Uncharted Bundle Plus an Extra Controller For $250Jillian Lucasjillian.lucas@gizmodomedia.com@jilldotcomCommerce Editor, Lifestyle | Send deal submissions to deals@gizmodomedia.comReply1 repliesLeave a replyYou may also likeThe SlotDid Paul Ryan Just Call This Press Conference a 'Waste of My Fucking Time'?

in disbelief.Autoblog       56m ago              in TransportationComments 238SharesShareTweetShareSaveMercedes-AMG\"We are the first to make pure bred F1 technology roadworthy.\" AMG has finally shown the mechanical layout of its thousand-horsepower, Formula 1-inspired Project One hypercar at a sneak reveal at the Nürburgring 24 Hour race. AMG Chairman Tobias Moers insists the car will become the new hypercar benchmark, with an F1-based 1.6-liter, electrified, turbocharged V6 and four electric motors.The all-wheel drive hypercar won't just deliver levels of performance unparalleled outside the world's racetracks, but will be able to run as a pure battery-electric car for up to 15 miles and, unique for a hypercar, its zero-emission mode will be front-wheel drive. That should make it capable of circumventing limitations on internal-combustion, high-powered cars in some city centers around the world.\"It shifts up the boundaries of what is technically feasible,\" AMG Chairman Tobias Moers said, with production limited to just 275 models. \"We are the first to make pure bred F1 technology roadworthy.\"\"Our objective is not speed, but to be the benchmark. If we have a strategy and we move into a new era of performance at AMG, maybe it's good to have something that opens the door in a very authentic way to that new era and this is it. \"Plug-in hybrid is going to be the future for AMG. We get more performance and more efficiency and what's wrong with that?\" he asked.Technically, though, Ferrari used a Formula One engine as the basis of its F50 supercar back in 1995, though Moers insists the Project One would be a class forward from the least loved of the hypercar Ferraris. \"We are talking about a high-performance hybrid, with one combustion engine and four electric motors. The combustion engine comes from Brixworth, from the same people who delivered three consecutive Formula One World Championships for drivers and manufacturers.\"The redline is at 11,000 and it has a high-tech turbo, which is driven by a 107-horsepower electric motor. Its batteries are the same technology and arrangement as in F1, but we will build four times the storage, with about 25km of pure electric range.\"We have reached thermal efficiency of 43 percent. Nobody else has managed anything like that, street legal.\"By comparison, AMG's 4.0-litre biturbo V8 has a thermal efficiency of around 25 percent.At $2.54 million, the two-seat, hard-top coupe follows Formula One practice by basing the entire car around a carbon-fibre chassis tub, then mounting the engine directly to the tub and mounting the gearbox and differential unit directly to the engine.Both the engine and eight-speed gearbox will be fully stressed parts of the chassis layout, while AMG has chosen to use a computer controlled clutch on a traditional manual gearbox, rather than the dual-clutch transmission layout most supercar makers, including Bugatti, favor.The first deliveries of the car are due late next year, with Moers hoping to finish its production run by the end of 2020, and AMG already has one \"mule\" prototype running to help with initial verification of the powertrain and chassis concept.But the key part of the technology is the Project One's powertrain itself, which AMG insists it pulled directly from its Formula 1 program. Though heavily revised from the W08 EQ Power+ F1 car used by Lewis Hamilton and Valteri Bottas this weekend in Monaco, AMG Chairman Tobias Moers insists the modifications are only basic.\"The idle speed is 1,100 rpm and in F1 it's 3,800 or 4,000. It revs to 11,000 rpm, but in F1 it's 13,500 rpm.\"We have to move combustion ratio, for example, that's what changes. In F1 they run Lambda that's way more than one. But we can't because of emissions. We have the same cylinder head, same crank housing but a different crankshaft.\"For all that, though, Moers insists customers won't need the usual array of Formula One race engineers and laptop computers to start the engine.\"Prospective buyers have been asking if they will require a support crew or dedicated lubricants to run it. My answer is always 'no.' It will be a street car. You keep it plugged in in the garage. You fill it with 98 (Ron fuel).\"The trickier parts of the powertrain will be the way it combines its electrified and internal-combustion power. A ground-breaking engine in Formula One, the AMG V6 splits its single, large turbocharger, with the exhaust turbine moved to the back of the engine with the exhaust system and the compressor wheel sitting at the front of the engine where the cooler air is. A shaft runs through the engine's vee angle to join them together.Firstly, there is the power and torque from the tiny 1.6-liter V6 (which AMG wouldn't talk about, but which must be somewhere around 470 hp). Then it also has a 134-hp electric motor (the MGU-K for \"kinetic\" in AMG-speak) directly attached to the engine's crankshaft and another 107-hp (the MGU-H for \"heat\") electric motor that spins up the turbocharger to eliminate turbo lag.\"The 80kW from the MGU-H is not so important to rev it (the turbocharger compressor) up but it's important for regeneration,\" Moers insisted. \"It could be a lot smaller to rev and still spin it up.\"Any excess energy the MGU-H harvests can be sent directly to the MGU-K to punch more electric torque directly through the crankshaft.Then there a 161-horsepower electric motor for each front wheel, which use essentially the same construction and design as the MGU-K, but in different housings.While Moers would not be drawn on the car's target weight, he did confirm that the entire powertrain would weight about 926 pounds, with the battery pack accounting for 220 lbs of that. The battery, built by its F1 supplier ABC, runs the same chemistry, cells and connectors as Hamilton's racer, but is four times larger to add in the Project One's zero-emission capability.What makes the Project One particularly complicated is that all of its electric motors act as both motors and generators to recharge the fast-discharge battery, which has a converter to turn 800 volts into 12 volts sitting on top of its housing.The extreme forces acting inside the highly stressed 1.6-liter V6 mean AMG will only rate it for 31,000 miles before it needs to be \"remanufactured\".\"We have an understanding of about 50,000 km. This is OK for us. I think that's good enough,\" Mr. Moers insisted.\"That's the life of the engine. Then we do some rework, like in a race car.\"After 31,000 miles, the engines would either be rebuilt by AMG or, depending on the work needed, replaced, and AMG didn't rule out customers choosing to buy the car with a spare engine ready to go. As an aside, it has yet to put a price tag on either a new engine or a rebuild.This year's Formula One rules dictate that each driver can only use four hybrid power units for the entire 20-race season, though that drops to three of the V6 internal-combustion engines next year. While that's just over 3,728 miles of Grand Prix racing, the engines and electrified power units could easily double that with four hours of practice and a one-hour qualifying shootout each race weekend.The supercar industry's widespread reaction to Moers' claims of using a Formula One motor has been disbelief.Ferrari basically said it doesn't believe Mercedes-AMG. Ferrari, the only other race-winning Formula One engine supplier this year, clearly doubts whether AMG's hypercar was a) using an F1-sourced engine and b) whether that was a good idea in the first place.In an interview back at the Geneva Motor Show, Ferrari's road-car chief engineer, Michael Leiters, said there was no way Ferrari would follow suit.\"Putting an F1 engine into a road car? We already did it with the F50 and I'm not convinced it works. An F1 engine runs at 16,000 rpm. How can you use a car that revs to 16,000 rpm on the street? You can't, and if it doesn't rev to 16,000 rpm, you have to ask the question, what remains of the Formula 1 engine?\"Instead of actual F1 engine, I'm convinced it's better to take some concepts and innovations from a Formula 1 car. To make a supercar, I prefer to do it from scratch,\" he insisted.The all-wheel-drive Project One hypercar has fine torque vectoring at both ends, and eliminates the packaging difficulties of anti-roll bars via five-link suspension systems at both ends.AMG has separated the vertical bump and roll tasks in the suspension with two springs in series sharing a single damper, while the longest rear pushrod in the car world is mounted directly to the upright and in large part defines the car's aerodynamic package.It will use a variable ride height and a variable aerodynamic package, to get the best from its custom-developed Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 285/35 19 front and 335/30 20 tires, which ride on center-lock wheels.The transmission, too, will be similar to the Formula One car's eight-speed unit, strengthened for longevity, and using the electric motors to \"fill in\" any acceleration holes during gear changes.Moers insists the car will have different driving modes, ranging from the zero-emission front-drive BEV mode to a mode so aggressive it will be similar to a Grand Prix qualifying setup.

Ravenscraft19 minutes agoFiled to: habitsroutinecoffeemind hackspsychologyEditPromoteShare to KinjaToggle Conversation toolsGo to permalinkWhen you do something every day, even if you enjoy it, it becomes routine. Like your morning coffee. If you have a habit you used to love that’s become boring, give it up for a few days.AdvertisementAs advice site Barking Up the Wrong Tree explains, even the things we love most can become dull if they fall into habit. Maybe you started drinking coffee because you liked the taste, but now it’s just a thing you have to drink to get through the day. You don’t even enjoy it anymore. If you’ve reached that point, skip it for a few days to hit the reset button on your appreciation for it.What’s something you used to relish that you now take for granted? Did that first morning cup of coffee used to be a wonderful moment — and now it’s just something you hastily gulp down? Well, skip it for three days... And then, once the three days are over, oh man, SAVOR that coffee — or whatever it is that you’ve denied yourself.This can work for just about any indulgence that’s become habit. If you’ve grown bored of listening to music, your morning bagel, or even if you’re falling into a routine in your relationship, taking a step back from your habit can give you time to remember what your life is like without it. Take a few days without turning on the TV or playing that video game and see just how much you miss it by the end.AdvertisementStoicism Reveals 4 Rituals That Will Make You Happy | Barking Up the Wrong TreePhoto by Vesselin Dochkov.Eric Ravenscrafteric@lifehacker.com@lordravenscraftSenior Writer for Lifehacker.Gear from Kinja DealsBestsellers: Mohu Leaf    The Kole is a Beautiful, Thermal, Easily Pocketable Flask for EverythingSunday's Best Deals: Protein Sale, ThinkPad Yoga, Wireless Flash Drive, and MoreReplyLeave a replyYou may also likeThe Grapevine‘The Black Girl’ Stacey Dash Gets Canned By Fox NewsToday 8:47amGizmodoTrump Deletes Misspelled Tweet, Which May Be Illegal [Updated]Yesterday 11:03amio9Ah, So That's Why Leia Was at the Battle of Scarif in Rogue OneToday 11:00amRecent from Eric Ravenscraft11714.3KLifehacker · Eric RavenscraftGoogle's Instant Tethering Makes It Easier to Share Your Phone's ConnectionYesterday 1:00pm83KLifehacker · Eric RavenscraftOneDrive's Latest Beta Frees Up Storage Space On Your Phone With Photo BackupsFriday 5:30am2817.4KLifehacker · Eric RavenscraftCall and Ask to Have the Interest Rate Reduced On Your Credit CardsFriday 5:00amShareTweetAbout BlogNeed Help?Content GuideLifehacker StoreRedirecting to the Lifehacker store in  Disclaimer: You are leaving a Gizmodo Media Group, LLC website and going to a third party site, which is subject to its own privacy policy and terms of use.ContinuePermissionsPrivacyTerms of UseAdvertisingJobsRSS©2017 Gizmodo Media GroupKinja is in read-only mode.

The CDN market, estimated at $5bn today, is anticipated to be over $10bn by 2019. While the market is growing rapidly, can the giants learn to dance? How are the startup aiming slingshots at the legacy Goliaths? Newcomers like Stackpath aim to win by offering a “security first” CDN, which in the wake of the #CloudBleed can be a marketing differentiator. Above all, how will that elephant in the room – Amazon Cloudfront – trample all the unicorns?Looking back: A brief history of CDNsThe first wave of CDNs started with Akamai almost two decades ago in 1998. CDNs were designed to accelerate web content. In the world of constrained bandwidth, speed of delivery is affected by a variety of factors including page content and effective routing of traffic. Web companies that experience heavy web traffic needed a reliable, rapid mechanism to ensure uninterrupted service. Akamai promised all that, and then some.Within a year of its launch, Akamai went IPO and had Apple Computer as its logo customer. At the time, Apple constituted 45% of its total $1.2m revenues. Limelight Networks was a fast-follower to Akamai and was launched in 2001. It went public in 2007 but has not been able to catch up with Akamai. In 2016, Akamai posted $2.3bn in revenues with a market cap of over $10 billion. (Limelight Networks posted $170 million revenues in 2016 with a market cap of $290 million. Private Equity shops, take note.)Over time, websites became more dynamic and bloated, and we entered the SaaS /application era. And then, the shifts of cloud and mobility changed the way content was delivered and consumed. CDNs started to mitigate DDOS attacks. Add the growing demand for security to that mix and slowly but surely, the CDN universe is getting disrupted.Amazon launched its own CDN – Cloudfront in 2008. Cloudflare started circa 2009 offering content delivery, security and analytics. In 2011, Fastly got launched and recently announced a new $50m funding round. Stackpath raised $180m in a single round to disrupt CDN markets.  It’s CEO, Lance Crosby is a badass who started SoftLayer sold it to IBM for $2 bn. Having that kind of an exit made it easier for Lance to raise a war chest of $180m.CompanyYear StartedCapital RaisedInvestorsCloudflareJuly 2009$182 mNEA, Union Square Ventures, FidelityFastlyMarch 2011$179 mBattery Ventures, August Capital, Iconiq, Sapphire VenturesStackpath2015$180mABRY PartnersThese newcomers have created headaches for Akamai, eating into its margins steadily forcing the price down. Akamai’s Media Delivery Solutions revenue for 2016 was down 9% year-over-year. As CDNs supply-demand curve shifts, customers are enjoying price drops of 20% to 40%.Grappling with changesAs we enter the new applications / devops driven world, the developers will drive the nextgen CDN consumption. Dynamic microservices, Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) and of course, performance and security remains paramount.Let us look at some of the technological shifts:Bloated web pages: We are fat, getting fatter: Average bytes per web page has grown ~3X to 2.4 MB in the past five years, as reported by httparchive.orgAn Akamai study shows, web page load times for desktops have increased by 63.8% in two years, from 7.2 seconds (2013) to 11.8 seconds (2015). And when it comes to dynamic content, customized to enhance the user experience, all bets are off. Steven Sinofsky, the former President of Windows division of Microsoft tweeted recently about LinkedIn slow load time as his ‘favorite new feature’.The growth of video: As the CDNs attempt to deliver bloated pages, the type of content has shifted. The demand for video / live streaming / dynamic application content continues to grow. Video is expected to grow 4X by 2020 when Cisco predicts 82% of all IP traffic will be video. Video consumption during busy-hour Internet traffic (7pm-11pm) is expected to grow nearly 5-fold from 2015 to 2020. Dynamic content and bandwidth peaks is the new CDN game, away from static cached content.Mobile consumption increases: By 2020, ~30% of traffic is expected to come from smartphones. The average load time for mobile sites is much more worse – 19 seconds over 3G connections. In a September 2016 “The Need for Mobile Speed” study, Google found that 53% of mobile site visits are abandoned if pages take longer than 3 seconds to load. The data, based on analysis of more than 10,000 mobile Web domains suggested that mobile sites load in 5 seconds earn up to 2 times more mobile ad revenue than those whose sites load in 19 seconds.So publishers are motivated to drive for speed. And we all know that one second delay in Amazon’s web page load time could burn $1.6bn in sales. Accelerating content for mobile is a headache for CDNs.Not too far away in the future are gaming, VR/AR and IoT companies. The times they are a changing – and getting messier. Such technological changes are forcing CDNs to improve speed, while dealing with dynamic content.Optimizing traffic routes over diverse network pathways (ISP, 3G, mobile), balancing load / peak demand and ensuring security is now expected of CDNs. While legacy CDNs are slow to react, several upstarts are tackling traffic optimization, nextgen WAF and DevOps friendly CDNs.Optimization of routing:The routing of internet traffic is determined by an archaic Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which does not factor in timing for data routing. It only looks at the number of hops between two networks. But what if the route with least number of hops may be congested? Or the protocol picks a physically longer route?For example, a packet may traverse from San Francisco to Los Angeles via Brazil. What if there was a route with multiple hops but was much more faster? BGP works really well in terms of reliability. It is a fundamental technology on which the Internet is built, but BGP is sub-optimal from a latency (delays, jitter, and image freezing) standpoint.Teridion acts like the ‘waze of internet traffic’ and optimizes traffic routes using third party cloud. Its platform helps make real time packet routing decisions to avoid congested paths. Unlike CDNs, its solution scales on-demand and is not limited by upstream communication, pre-provisioned PoPs, geography or cloud providers. It is therefore much quicker to provision. As there is no caching of data, SSL certificate management, security and compliance issues are non-existent. It extends to each and every end-user of a cloud-delivered service.Chris Keene, chief executive of Teridion says, “As you add more options for acceleration, each has its own security implications and possible tradeoffs. Some companies do not want to share SSL Certificates and give up the keys to their kingdom. CDNs cannot do much for such companies.”Egnyte, an Enterprise File Sync and Sharing (EFSS) upstart beat some of the giants of file share companies such as Box, Citrix, Google and Microsoft. It was faster by 30% in speed over Box and as much as 60% for larger 4GB files.Egnyte was ranked one of the top vendors achieving high marks in a IDC study of sync performance of file share and storage vendors.  Kris Lahiri. Cofounder of Egnyte says, “The IDC speed test looked at the time to “synchronize” content between the local client and the cloud. This is bidirectional, so any changes made on endpoints needed to be synchronized ASAP. We used a robust web socket connection, smart clients and Teridion’s network acceleration. All these different optimizations got reflected in the results observed by IDC.”Instead of the conventional CDN path, Egnyte created its own PoPs and partnered with Teridion to optimize the route dynamically in a continuously optimized fashion. In such a scenario, no SSL off-loading was required and that reduced the potential attack surface. ​Peter Christy of 451 Research pointed out that Teridion is clever non-obvious technology and for any CDN, it would take time and effort to replicate it. “Even then, it will likely be inferior initially. And then time and effort will be required to operate, maintain and improve such an offering.” While optimized routing is one of the CDN areas of innovation, security is another hot area.Content + security = Better CDNCDNs moved into security by offering DDoS protection. A site could be taken down with a flood of requests. With a CDN fronting the traffic, the netflow traffic patterns can be analyzed and scrubbed inline. In recent times, CDNs have started to push into offering Web Application Firewalls (WAF) and Bot mitigation. Enterprise customers now look to CDNs to manage web security. Akamai’s Cloud Security Solutions 2016 revenue was up 43% year-over-year.While CDNs aim for improved security, CDNs themselves can be vulnerable. In his blog post, David Hobbs writes about several CDN security challenges which include dynamic content attacks, SSL based attacks and direct IP attacks. The recent Cloudbleed incident shows that infrastructure complexity has its tradeoffs. Peter Christy of 451 Research says, “Cloudbleed was frightening because it leaked private information for some Cloudflare customers. I’m sure most people didn’t think even possible.Cloudbleed and the recent AWS S3 problems were both good ole “bugs” — longstanding interactions between complex systems that often go unnoticed.” Cloudbleed and Heartbleed (a 2014 bug) were examples where customer data that should have been shielded got leaked.In another study, sixteen CDNs failed in a simulated forwarding loop attack.  Here, a malicious customer of any CDN can create forwarding loops inside CDNs. Forwarding loops can cause CDNs to process one client request repetitively effectively launching a DoS attacks against CDNs.So far, DDoS attacks against web sites was well know but this was the first time when a DoS attack can be launched against a CDN itself by one of its customers. Its often easy to sign up for a CDN and get a free account. Launching a forward loop attack is not too difficult.Andrew Petersen, CEO of Signal Sciences is building the next generation Web Access Firewall (WAF) that combines security with usability for the DevOps world. Having faced these challenges in his previous life at Etsy, Andrew and his team have taken a bottoms up approach.“CDNs can’t get deployed on internal apps. As multiple security tools have to be used it gets harder to manage quickly. If we take a step back, CDNs primary focus is speed. Philosophically and technically, this creates tradeoffs with performance” Petersen says.In his blog post, Zane Lackey, co-founder of Signal Sciences identified six appsec challenges that CDNs may struggle to solve. The development environment is unlikely to have the same configuration as production due to cost and architecture restrictions.As these environments don’t match, a CDN-based WAF will often trigger false positives in production that are completely unreproducible in development. Debugging failures at this level is frustrating, because access to the CDN console is restricted to the operations team. In practice, a CDN-based WAF is not very friendly to those pursuing DevOps.From Centralized to Dispersed: The Cloud becomes the EdgeErnie Regalado, Editor-in-Chief of Bizety, a market research publication says “Edge security as a business model has taken off and it is fastest growing segment in the industry. Companies like CloudFlare, Incapsula and Distil Networks are pushing to offer DDoS Mitigation, WAF and Bot Mitigation.”  Window Snyder, Chief Security Officer at Fastly echoes the sentiment, “We see data / traffic patterns, understand vulnerabilities and can enhance edge security to further protect our customers in specific ways.” In this classic innovator’s dilemma, the newcomers are able to start with a clean slate, while incumbents work from their position of strength. Fastly recently announced a $50m funding round claiming a $100m annual run rate. Yet Fastly could become slowly if another “edge CDN” Stackpath continues down its war path. With 45 PoPs in 25 Cities, Stackpath has grown rapidly via five acquisitions including MaxCDN and Highwinds, offering integrated acceleration and security The Modern Day CDN should do a lot more. (Image Courtesy: Stackpath)James Leaverton, VP Ecosystem Development, Stackpath says “Legacy CDNs are not ready for the shifts to online video and IoT. They have Frankenstein platforms—a user might have to log into a dozen different portals. They have aging infrastructures that were optimized for CDN, but not built to adapt or scale. That’s why companies like ours exist. The StackPath platform is an integrated response to a fragmented problem created by too many delivery and security solutions.”The DevOps friendly CDNAs developers become the prime focus for some startups, a DevOps friendly CDN based in Colorado, Section.io is slowly but surely establishing its roots.(Disclosure: I am an investor in Section.io via Secure Octane seed fund).Backed by Techstars Ventures, Section.io CEO Stewart McGrath wanted to build a platform for developers. Dev teams need new control tools and flexibility in staging and testing their content. “They really have no idea how the site will run until they get into production. And then you need the visibility / metrics once you are in production “ says Stewart.To manage traffic, CDNs use different types of reverse proxies such as squid cache, Nginx or Varnish Cache. In a containerized environment, you could have multiple reverse proxies to choose from. In his blog post titled CDN’s are dying, Stewart argues that engineers should not feel locked into any one proxy software stack at any one time. Rather, they should be able to pick and choose the tools that work best for their website.The multi-tenancy also allows isolation, reducing risk of contamination. Section.io aims to decouple proxy software from the networks and takes a software-driven approach to configuration, management and deployment of reverse proxies. “We believe this is the future of a web application delivery platform. Developers can have full control over reverse proxy configuration and experiment in a testing environment” says Stewart.The ease of installation, testing, performance and troubleshooting changes how developers can manage their processes from end to end. For legacy CDNs, this will be a challenge in the long run.As technology needs evolve, innovators are often able offer better solutions and expand certain markets. Ernie Regalado of Bizety writes that the CDN market is likely to be much larger, especially as hungry CDNs invade other tech sectors seeking new revenue streams. He expects the overall market to grow to $12bn by 2019.This is driven by a convergence (or a collision) between several markets such as CDNs, Multiprotocol label switching (MPLS), Software Defined Wide Area Networks (SD-WAN) market and the Cloud Radio Access Network (RAN) market. Companies like Cato Networks, Aryaka and Versa Networks have raised significant rounds of capital and are making strides in these segments.Betting on the winnersOn one end, web companies like Facebook, Netflix, Pandora and even Apple have shifted to managing their own content delivery. Legacy CDNs, left with no choice but to evolve. Should the giant Akamai worry about the cold Cloudfront blowing in from Seattle? According to Datanyze research on CDN markets, AWS Cloudfront is eating its way up from the bottom of the market and leads in the Alexa Top 1 million domains while Akamai is strong in the Top 100 domains.# of Akamai Domains# of AWS Cloudfront DomainsAlexa Top 100208Alexa Top 100018279Alexa Top 100,00030046275Alexa Top 1 million8,73835,902Meanwhile, Amazon has steadily crept up and added AWS WAF in 2015 and AWS Shield (DDoS mitigation) in 2016. How will this battle play out remains to be seen. Ernie Regalado says “AWS is the dominant provider of centralized cloud compute services. Akamai is the leader in edge services, including delivery, security and streaming. As processing, data and business logic move to the edge, Akamai has the advantage and can even disrupt AWS.”Cloudflare, Stackpath and Fastly have raised enough capital.  Who gets acquired or goes public remains to be seen. My hunch is Lance will aim for an IPO for Stackpath – it’s unlikely he will be content with anything less, especially knowing his last exit was a $2bn outcome. That could create some heartburn for Cloudflare and Fastly. The young Turks like Distil Networks, Section. io, Teridion, and Signal Sciences could raise mucho dinero, and become standalone companies.Telecom carriers and service providers will likely make some moves as networks converge with ‘software driven everything’. Those in the enviable nimbler / innovators category will win, no matter which way the wind blows.Featured Image: Dimitri Otis/Getty Images0SHARESAdvertisementAdvertisement Crunchbase Full profile for   Sapphire Ventures Founded1996OverviewSapphire Ventures, with more than US$1.4 billion under management, is an investment firm that seeks to partner with outstanding entrepreneurs and leading venture firms worldwide to build global category leaders.

Plus, new details of a major Black Panther action scene, and a classic Doctor Who monster returns once more. Behold, Spoilers!DeadpoolSpeaking to The Playlist, writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick are surprisingly and refreshingly optimistic about Ryan Reynold’s aims to get Hugh Jackman to star in a Deadpool/Wolverine crossover film. Here’s Wernick:Advertisement We’ve come a long way from 2009, when we couldn’t get the movie off the ground ’til now. And to have [this team-up]? It would be amazing to have Hugh resurrect Wolverine in the Deadpool universe, and again, Ryan’s making a hard push to make that happen, and hopefully the public gets behind it and we can all convince Hugh to put the claws on one more time.But if one did go through, according to Reese, it’d require a pretty big shuffling of the plans the pair currently have for the Deadpool movie universe:Advertisement Yeah, [a crossover] would, if you think about it. If you’re looking at Deadpool 2, if you’re looking at X-Force, if you’re looking at Deadpool 3, there’s not necessarily room for [another] team-up movie. I think it does create real scheduling and universe issues and something that could be ironed out, but it would need to be ironed out. I don’t think any of us operated under the assumption that it would be even possible to do a Deadpool/Wolverine thing, so we just haven’t planned for it, it’s still not in the plan, but if it were to happen, it would require a hard look at the overall architecture of our storylines.LoganDirector James Mangold explains why Patrick Stewart’s elderly Charles Xavier has some hair in the movie:[It] could be kind of sacrilege. The theory was that he originally lost all his hair because it’s just too damn busy [in his head] to grow hair – the idea for me was, well, maybe there’s a little fringe on there, because things are slowing down mentally. [Empire]Black PantherAccording to Variety, production is headed to South Korea to film a huge chase scene between Black Panther and the film’s primary villain, featuring 150 cars, 700 people, and even a few helicopters to boot. Oh, and loads of gunfire, obviously.Thor: RagnarokDirector Taika Waititi compares the scale of the movie to something like Civil War:AdvertisementSponsored Sometimes I would stop and think, I’m doing a movie that’s got Thor and Doctor Strange and The Incredible Hulk and Loki and every character is so strange and different. Civil War it’s just humans, humans with human problems. Ours is creatures and beings and all these sorts of really different characters. Again displaying human problems, but in outer space or in other worlds.He also confirms that he’s going to make a cameo appearance in the movie, but didn’t disclose the role:AdvertisementIt’s not like a thing that I’ve ever planned, but now I’m in all of my movies in a small role or a larger role. I’ll probably just keep doing that. It’s like a dumb thing I do now.[AV Club]SuspiriaFilming on the remake of the horror classic has now wrapped. [Deadline]Robin Hood: OriginsVisually, the film will be heavily inspired by John Wick, according to producer Basil Iwanyk:AdvertisementAdvertisementThe images of Robin Hood, the imagery we have, the production design, the stunt work that we’re doing—a lot of it was inspired by the John Wick stunt work. The stuff we’re doing with the bow and arrow, it’s the same thing that Keanu does with the gun. The costumes, it just feels different than any other Robin Hood we had.Iwanyk goes on to describe the film’s gritty, PTSD-driven angle on the Robin Hood legend.Exempting the killer cast, I feel that it captures the adventure and the fun and the spirit of Robin Hood, but because it’s the origin story—it’s a kid going off to war thinking he’s going on a great Crusade, and realizing it’s all bullshit and coming back with some PTSD and realizing he’s been lied to, and coming back to kind of a fractured society that doesn’t really accept him and realizing, ‘Okay the super rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting poorer.’ You could describe that now. What Joby Harold, our writer, was able to do is make it feel very allegorical and very contemporary, and feel youthful but not youthful in a YA way, youthful in a kind of, the anger, the energy, what people when they were 25 feel, without it being pandering like ‘Look, we’re the young version of the movie!’[Collider]Kong: Skull IslandThe new Imax poster is very Kongpocalypse Now.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2USA Today has revealed a handful of new but not very revealing stills from the film; head to the link to see more.The X-Men TV ShowBryan Singer reconfirms Matt Nix’s recent tease that the series will feature some familiar mutant characters:AdvertisementAdvertisement Some crossover is all I can really say. I can’t really speak to that. I come in and out of it, sort of, but I’ve been involved in it for about 20 years — I signed the deal in ’96! I think there’ll just be crossover and standalone. It’s just the right thing to do. The X-Men universe is every bit as big as the rest of the whole Marvel universe, so why not?[Mashable]Doctor WhoClassic Who monsters the Ice Warriors will re-return in season 10, according to writer (and Sherlock co-creator) Mark Gatiss. You can also expect “a new kind of Ice Warrior” according to the Gatiss, who also wrote the Ice Warriors’ earlier return in season eight’s “Cold Blood.” That was a great episode, so we’re looking forward to this.Shannara ChroniclesA lengthy plot synopsis for the second season has been released:Season two picks up a year following the events of the finale and focuses on a reemergence of magic that terrifies the citizens of Arbolorn, thanks to a shadowy organization called The Crimson charged with hunting down anyone practicing sorcery and sewing discord among the citizenry of The Four Lands. Meanwhile, a still mourning Wil is forced to abandon his plans to become a healer and rejoin the fight when he’s saved from a Crimson attack; fortunately, he’s soon reunited with Eretria and the two venture off the find Allanon. Only they’re confronted with Bandon’s journey to the dark side, which includes a mission to resurrect an evil known as The Warlock Lord.Joining the cast of The Shannara Chronicles for season two are Malese Jow (Star-Crossed) as Mareth, the unpredictable, independent young woman who rescues Wil from the Crimson and forms an instant connection with the half-elf; Vanessa Morgan (Finding Carter) as Lyria, a mysterious young woman romantically linked to Eretria; Desmond Chiam (NCIS) as General Rigam, a former top dog under Evertine whose fingerprints are all over the chaos in The Four Lands; Gentry White (UnREAL) as charismatic bounty hunter Garet, known throughout the Four Lands as The Weapons Master; and Caroline Chikezie (Everly) as Queen Tamlin, the ruler of the only human kingdom in The Four Lands.Agents of SHIELDEpisode 15 of the current season is titled “Self Control.” Ominous, given that the back half of the season is all about Life Model Decoys.

for $10Thorin Klosowski8 minutes agoFiled to: lawdvdscomputerslawsuitsclass action1EditPromoteShare to KinjaToggle Conversation toolsGo to permalinkIf you purchased a computer between April 1 2003 and December 31, 2008 that included a DVD drive, you might be eligible to claim $10 from a class action lawsuit.AdvertisementThe class action suit started seven years ago when Sony, NEX, Panasonic, and Hitachi were accused of colluding to inflate prices of optical drives. Now, if you purchased a computer during those dates, you’re eligible for some free money, but there is a catch. First off, only about half the U.S. is eligible, including: Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, or Wisconsin.AdvertisementSecond, this is still just a bit of a reconnaissance operation. Right now, they’re collecting names and emails from people, but you don’t need to actually prove that you owned one of these drives in any way, so it’s unclear exactly when or how you’d get paid out.

The city is booming, and the blistering pace at which Upfront was able to close the fund (from launch to close within two-and-a-half months, according to managing partner, Mark Suster), is just another sign that the technology scene in Los Angeles is ascendant.Indeed, at the firm’s  Upfront Summit, an invite only affair for investors, entrepreneurs, tastemakers and celebrities held earlier this year, Suster managed to wrangle celebrity entrepreneurs and investors like Kobe Bryant, Baron Davis, Tyra Banks, and Gwyneth Paltrow (and the mayor) to pitch the wonders of Los Angeles to the investment community.The $400 million oversubscribed fund is the largest ever raised in the city, Suster said, noting that the close brings the firms total assets under management to $2 billion.“LA has truly arrived,” Suster tells me. “In the past people were reluctant to see a really big VC in LA.Roughly 45% of the capital from the new fund will likely d be deployed in Los Angeles and Suthern California, Suster said. Indeed, a number of early stage and Series A-focused investment vehicles will likely feed into the already bulging ecosystem of strong startup companies.Suster declined to comment on the performance of the firm’s latest fund, but did say that its second fund was the best performing fund of its vintage, with investments in BillMeLater, Overture, and Investnet.Now with big bets on Ring, Loot Crate, GOAT, and TrueCar, there’s been a shift toward more consumer-focused offerings that can leverage what Tyra Banks has called Los Angeles'”silicon reach”.What limited partners were drawn to, in the funds ‘ latest closing was its track record. “What they saw was differentiation and performance,” said Suster. “A fund formed in Silicon Valley is competing for deal with every other manager.”While the size of the fund has expanded Upfront has also expanded its team, meaning the focus of the firm’s investments will remain on seed and Series A round investors. “Almost 90% of the deals are sed capital and Series,” Suster said.Five years ago the firm had four partners, and now the firm employs six partners — including new addition Kobie Fuller, who came to Upfront from Accel in the past year.Now the firm’s investment partners include founder  Yves Sisteron, Greg Bettinelli, Kara Nortman, Fuller, Suster, and Kevin Zhang. Stuart Lander is the firm’s partner in charge of operations and platform teams for the firm.Upfront Ventures managing partner Mark Suster and founder Yves SisteronFor Suster, Upfront’s success is a function of a broader trend toward the geographical dispersion of successful investment funds throughout the U.S.Pointing to Bijan Sabet’s Spark Capital in Boston, to Fred Wilson’s Union Square Ventures in New York, and Philadelphia’s First Round Capital helmed by Josh Kopelman, Suster noted that the diversification of venture is more than just a consequence of geography.In a city like Los Angeles, which graduates more engineers than any other American urban center, and which has a broad, diverse background, gender and racial diversity are just as important to a firm’s success as the capital it raises.Suster underscored the importance of this in his own blog post about the fund’s close, writing:Upfront has long held the view that with regards to equality we should DO more than SAY but the events of the last weeks have led us to want to verbalize more our deep-seated commitment to equality in funding founders across ethnicities, nationalities and genders. We believe this isn’t just a market statement — it is where we will drive huge and differentiated returns.Dating back to Upfront II in 2000 (the single best performing fund in the US for that vintage) 2 of our 3 best returns were driven by companies with female founders / CEOs.More recently reports have come out listing VC firms ranked by percentage of female founders where we’re usually listed in the top 5% nationally.In our most recent fund ~30% of the companies we’ve backed have had at least one of the primary founders as a woman.As the firm looks ahead to its own future, Suster and the firm he’s helped grow remain committed to the future of Los Angeles. The two are paired and these days if an investor is #LongLA (to use the hashtag the firm coined), it looks like limited partners are saying that it pays to be long on Upfront as well.0SHARESAdvertisementAdvertisement CrunchbaseMark Suster BioMark Suster is a Partner at Upfront Ventures.

Violet Blue, @violetblue       29m ago              in SecurityComments 151SharesShareTweetShareSaveIllustration by D. Thomas MageeRepresentative Tom Graves (R-GA) thinks that when anyone gets hacked -- individuals or companies -- they should be able to \"fight back\" and go \"hunt for hackers outside of their own networks.\" The Active Cyber Defense Certainty (\"ACDC\") Act is getting closer to being put before lawmakers, and the Congressman trying to make \"hacking back\" easy-breezy-legal believes it would've stopped the WannaCry ransomware.Despite its endlessly lulzy acronym, Graves says he \"looks forward to formally introducing ACDC\" to the U.S. House of Representatives in the next few weeks.Hacking back sounds really awesome at first glance, and obviously, especially to lawmakers. The hacking back of \"ACDC\" in action would most likely happen just like on Mr. Robot, or in that movie about black hats. Evil hackers invade a company's computer system and plant a cyber-bomb. Except the company's IT department is actually a crack team of formerly-evil hackers who now work for the good guys (you can tell they're the good guys because they have jobs). Because it's now legal, the good guys dive into The Matrix and defuse the cyber-bomb just in time! Then they fly through the wires to get into the bad guy's computer, instantly downloading his name and address and Tinder profile, sending it instantly to the FBI who bust through the guy's door right as he's trying to wipe the files!Yeah, that's probably how lawmakers see it happening, too.Attacks that go both waysThe bipartisan ACDC bill would let companies who believe they are under ongoing attack break into the computer of whomever they think is attacking them, for the purposes of stopping the attack or gathering info for law enforcement. According to early press, the bill \"includes caveats such as you cannot destroy data on another person's computer, cause physical injury to someone or create a threat to public safety.This is Rep Graves's second attempt at making ACDC work out with all his friends. His May 25th revision of the legislation included attempts at limiting collateral damage, which as you may have suspected, is a particular criticism of people who work in infosec.According to Politico, who had the early scoop on the new version:Key changes include: a mandatory reporting requirement for entities that use active-defense technique to help federal law enforcement ensure such tools are used responsibly; a two-year sunset clause that would make Congress revisit the law in order to make changes; and an exemption allowing people or companies to recover their lost data if it's found using defensive techniques and can be grabbed back without destroying other data.Setting aside the naive idea that digital secrets can somehow be \"stolen back,\" just that information alone diagrams why hacking back generally isn't considered a great idea by most.Brian Bartholomew, senior security researcher at Kaspersky Lab, told Engadget, \"While the proposal's intent is to make it more difficult for an attack to be successful, it also raises major concern within the community.\" He explained that for starters, it's impossible to contain what data the victim touches when they're hacking back, destroying the bill's rule that victims only mess with their own stolen property.\"Another concern is for chain of custody preservation,\" Bartholomew told Engadget, even if victims tell law enforcement what they're about to do. \"Providing a 'plan of action' is a far cry from possessing the proper training or legal expertise on how to preserve evidence that will be upheld in a court of law,\" he explained. \"It is only a matter of time until the first criminal is prosecuted and evidence [is] thrown out due to improper chain of custody or documentation.\"Attribution is hard and usually wrong when not done by teams of professional analysts. And even then they get it wrong thanks to the incredible skills attackers have at what's called \"false flagging\" -- making attacks look like they're from someone else.Bartholomew, who co-authored the leading research on \"false flag operations\" agreed:\"As it has been demonstrated many times before, attackers are becoming more and more aware of techniques to throw defenders off their scent and lead them down a wrong path.\"\"Pointing the proverbial finger at another attacker is becoming more commonplace and with the introduction of this bill, the possible outcome of such an act can potentially be devastating. Performing proper attribution of an attack is an already difficult and sometimes impossible task, especially for an untrained person.\"There is also the serious concern that a hack back attack might spark a bigger issue between nations than anyone's considering.Last September, the Ethics + Emerging Sciences Group at Cal Poly released a report called \"Ethics of Hacking Back,\" a neutral look at the issues and laws surrounding the infosec version of \"an eye for an eye.\"The report comes from the stance that reasonable arguments exist to support hacking back. Still, in a summary from Patrick Lin, Ph.D., the group's Director, Cal Poly found that the concept of hacking back fails across a number of categories. \"If meant as a deterrent,\" Lin wrote, \"hacking back would likely not deter malicious and ideological attackers.\"Importantly, the paper cuts to the heart of all hacking back discussions by raising a critical issue: We don't know if it would actually work or not because there is no data. \"Currently,\" Lin said, \"there is no self-reporting of hacking back, because the practice is presumed to be 'likely illegal' according to the U.S. Department of Justice.\"We cannot track what we do not measure. Without that data—a way for individuals and organizations to safely report countermeasures, without fear of being made into criminals—it is difficult to answer the question of whether hacking back has deterrent value, which is an empirical question.More to the ideological point of Graves's bill, Lin points out that hacking back also won't do anything to restore security.By peddling the idea that hacking back could've stopped WannaCry -- ransomware -- ACDC is security snake oil. It's reminiscent of the \"anonymity box\" gold rush that hit Kickstarter after the Snowden snatch and dump, where charlatans sold \"Tor in a box\" promising that their gadgets would've prevented the Sony hack. Just take a recent, dimly-understood hacking disaster and graft on an infantile solution, don't bother to consult people in the trenches, and off we go.When you try to make laws about hacking based on a child's concept of \"getting someone back,\" you're getting very far and away from making yourself secure. It's like trying to make gang warfare productive. Or trying to make it legal to break into someone's house to steal your stuff back and take photos, because they broke into yours, except without anything in your favor of going right. Unless you're really, really good at different kinds of hacking. Spoiler: most everyone in hacking and security isn't, no matter how hard they try to make us all think all hackers are good at everything.It's a smarmy and conceited bill to propose. But that seems to be going around Washington DC lately, so good luck to us.Images: Yuri_Arcurs via Getty Images (Guys at computer); EFE/EPA/RITCHIE B.

It’s rolling out “Related Articles” that appear below news links to stories lots of people are posting about on Facebook, or that are suspected to be false news and have been externally fact checked by Facebook’s partners. Appearing before someone reads, Related Articles will surface links to additional reporting on the same topic to provide different view points, and to truthiness reports from the fact checkers.If users see drastically different angles when they compare a story to its Related Articles, they might deem it suspicious and skip it, be less likely to believe or share it, or could click through the Related Articles and make up their own mind. That could reduce the spread and impact of false news without Facebook itself having to be the honesty police. Related Articles could also balance out some of the radical invective that can subtly polarize the populace.Pre-click Related Articles are rolling out in the US, Germany, France, and Nederlands today. These countries were chosen to get the roll out first because Facebook has established fact checking partnerships there. “We don’t want to be and are not the arbiters of the truth. The fact checkers can give the signal of whether a story is true or false” says Facebook News Feed integrity product manager Tessa Lyons.Meanwhile, Facebook’s machine learning algorithm has improved its accuracy and speed, so the social network  will now have it send more potential hoaxes to fact checkers. Lyons explains that the speed is important because “The sooner we can get potential false new stories to fact checkers, the sooner that they can review them, and the more we reduce the number of people who are actually exposed to them.”Facebook has shown Related Articles after people click links since at least 2014. Even then it was getting flack for dispensing fake news. In April of this year Facebook tested the new pre-click version as part of its multi-prong attack on fake news following criticism that misinformation influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election. That includes downranking hoaxes and click bait, reducing referral traffic to ad-filled spam sites to cut off their funding, and promoting local journalism and news literacy. Most directly, it partnered with Snopes, AP, PolitiFact and others external agencies so it can add warning labels to stories externally vetted as false.“People told us that Related Articles gave them more context about topics and that having more context helps them make more informed decisions and about what they read and what they decide to share” Lyons tells me. “Seeing Fact Checker’s articles in Related Articles actually helps people identify whether what they’re reading is misleading or false.”Facebook won’t be personalizing the Related Articles that show a column of thumbnail images and headlines below a link story. However, it does utilize other quality signals from News Feed ranking to show the optimal alternative takes. Thankfully, Lyons says Facebook doesn’t plan to put any ads in the Related Articles box.So how does Facebook avoid accidentally showing more fake news in Related Articles? Facebook tells me it uses the same signals as its Trending section, and disqualifies posts that lots of people are commenting on or reporting as false. No humans are involved in the process, which at least removes the potential for direct bias, though humans tend to code their subconscious biases into their algorithms.If Facebook can’t convince the world it’s got a real handle on the fake news problem, it may see people tune into the News Feed or click its links less. That interferes with Facebook’s ad-driven business model and its mission. Plus, it’s liable to get blamed for future election results.While objectively fake news gets the majority of the attention, it’s exaggeration and warped opinion that are much more prevalent and therefore potentially polarizing. If extreme right and left publishers’ articles get paired with centrist Related Articles, it could dissuade people from blindly swallowing the rants and raves that tear society apart.Featured Image: Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch0SHARESAdvertisementAdvertisement Newsletter SubscriptionsThe Daily CrunchGet the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inboxTC Weekly RoundupGet a weekly recap of the biggest tech storiesCrunchbase DailyThe latest startup funding announcementsEnter AddressSubscribeSEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report Instagram Stories Turns One | Crunch ReportWatch More Episodesfake newsFacebookAppsPopular Posts Featured Stories Instagram Stories Turns One | Crunch ReportVIDEO | 3:38 | Crunch Report WTF is bitcoin cash and is it worth anything?13 hours ago | Fitz Tepper Eat the suburbs16 hours ago | John Biggs Meadow is the Amazon of weed16 hours ago | Josh Constine Instagram Stories turns 1 as daily use surpasses Snapchat21 hours ago | Josh ConstineLatest From Mobile LG confirms its next smartphone will feature a massive six-inch OLED screen3 hours ago | Jon Russell ‘Paranormal Activity’ director Oren Peli launches a new social app8 hours ago | Anthony Ha Apple Pay is coming to Sweden, Denmark, Finland, the UAE and more banks16 hours ago | Romain Dillet Hustle scores $8M to kill telemarketing with personalized texts18 hours ago | Josh Constine Comment moderation powered by  Up NextSmall business loan platform Kabbage nabs $250M from SoftbankPosted 20 minutes ago  CrunchBoardJob ListingsSales & Marketing Support Specialist @ Athos at Athos (Redwood City, CA, United States)Sr. Lead Software Engineer at Neighborly Labs, Inc.

Challenge. This month, we’re bringing back one of last year’s favorites: kick your spending weakness.We all have problem spending areas, and while we don’t want to keep you from spending money on things you enjoy, we do want to help you spend more mindfully. This means cutting back on things you buy impulsively then later regret. Your spending weakness might be restaurants. Or it could be gadgets. Or it might just be random daily deals. If you’re not sure what your weakness is, take a moment to look at your budget and analyze your spending. Maybe your finances are already optimized, but if you’re like most people, you have a few areas you can work on.How to Program Your Mind to Stop Buying Crap You Don’t NeedHow to Program Your Mind to Stop Buying Crap You Don’t NeedHow to Program Your Mind to Stop Buying Crap You…We all buy things from time to time that we don't really need.

We have a few ideas and tools to help you get started:AdvertisementAdvertisementControl Impulse Spending By Asking How a Purchase Improves Your LifeThink of Impulsive Shopping as the Enemy of Your Financial GoalsAmazon Contemplate Forces You to Think Twice About Your Amazon PurchasesGet Out of Debt by Switching to a Cash-Only PolicyThe “3D” method: determine, distract, delayDelete your saved payment info onlineAt the end of the month, we’ll all report back and compare our spending. Ideally, you’ll kick the habit and make it a permanent thing. Of course, you want to actually save the money you save, too—there’s little point in cutting back on impulsive spending in one area just to blow it in another. You in?

From throwing money at training in in-demand fields like coding, to simply making life easier for people in low-wage positions, Mountain View is looking to the future. For example, the internet juggernaut knows that college isn't for everyone, so it's working on a tool so people can easily compare vocational and technical training programs. Google hasn't specified how such a system will work, or how many training providers will be included, but in theory it'd put tech-ed programs alongside one another so you could find out which would suit your needs or offer the skills needed to land a job in your current city.Missing a day of work can dramatically alter a paycheck, so Google has partnered with the National Domestic Workers Alliance and its Alia program to assist low-income workers. Contributing a \"small\" amount of money each month means that if you're hurt, Alia will supplement your income so a sick day doesn't sting your checking account so badly. It sounds a lot like what Geico offers -- passive income when you're not able to clock in to work. And to help people find jobs in the first place, Google is giving money to French company Bayes Impact, which uses machine learning to analyze job-seeking strategies and listings to make finding your dream position less of a grind.Coupled with Google Hire, it hints that the firm might be ahead of the curve when it comes to modern employment.

Steve Dent, @stevetdent       17m ago              in WearablesComments 112SharesShareTweetShareSaveAOLWith thousands of apps and Oculus behind it, Samsung's Gear VR is already a great virtual reality headset for Galaxy S8 and S8+ owners, and comes with a new controller to boot. It's always good to have more choice, though, and users of Samsung's flagship smartphones can now use Google's Daydream View, too. On a Google+ post, the search giant confirmed that \"the Daydream-ready update is rolling out now to Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+\" smartphones.While lagging behind Samsung in terms of games and apps, the Daydream View made a strong debut thanks in large part to its comfortable cloth construction. It also comes with a small motion controller, and when it was unveiled, the Gear VR didn't have one -- you had to buy a separate gamepad or make do with with a touchpad on the side of the headset. Shortly after the Daydream VR launch, Samsung unveiled a new Gear VR and controller for the Galaxy S8, S7 and S6 smartphones.The Galaxy S8 or S8+ confer the same benefits to the Daydream VR headset as to the Gear VR. Both phones have arguably the best AMOLED screens on the market with nearly the highest resolutions (2,960 x 1,440) for crisp viewing, fast processors to crunch games and plenty of RAM. They also feature expandable microSD storage up to 256GB -- indispensable for VR video files, which are often enormous.If you're looking at the Daydream VR, it's currently on sale for a limited time in the US at $60 instead of $80. The Daydream VR app is now available on Google Play and should work on your Galaxy S8 or S8+ with no OTA update necessary, users are reporting. If you're having trouble, some Reddit users say that you may need to clear Google VR Services data on your device, then re-open the Daydream app.         Via:        Droid Life        Source:                Google (Google+)In this article:    Daydream,                GalaxyS8,                GalaxyS8Plus,                gear,                google,                headset,                mobile,                samsung,                VirtualReality,                VR,                wearables 112SharesShareTweetShareSaveCommentsSign In    17m   17m ago in    Wearables                    Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and S8+ now support Daydream View VR               Google's headset currently costs half as much as a Gear VR.

neatairplanesairportslanding41EditPromoteShare to KinjaToggle Conversation toolsGo to permalinkGIF London’s Heathrow Airport is one of the busiest airports in the world, so it’s no surprise that if you look up in the sky during the morning rush, you’ll see a line of airplanes swarming around, patiently waiting to land on its runways. This video from TopFelya shows 30 minutes of morning arrivals and there’s a plane coming in every other minute.

Handling air traffic control at Heathrow must be a never ending game of stress.Casey Chancchan@gizmodo.com@caseychanEditor, SploidRecommended Stories    Neat Video Shows Two Passenger Jets Landing Side-By-Side at the Same Time    Interesting Animation Explains How Airplanes Are Able to FlyThere's an Air Highway That Keeps Planes From Crashing Into Each OtherGear from Kinja DealsYour Top Five Picks For Best Gaming Headset (2016)You Won't Want to Hide OXO's Pop Containers in the PantryThis $17 Tea Sampler is A Tea-Lover's DreamReply4 repliesLeave a replyYou may also likeGizmodoPresident Trump Reportedly Still Using His Favorite Unsecured Cellphone [Updated]Today 4:49pmSploidNeat Video Shows Two Passenger Jets Landing Side-By-Side at the Same Time6/13/16 8:30pmKotaku · Kotaku StaffThe 12 Best Games For The Xbox One12/24/16 10:00amRecent from Casey Chan39Sploid · Casey ChanRestoring a Rusty Butcher's Knife Found in the Trash Back to a Sparkly Blade Is Damn Nice17 minutes ago1932556.9KSploid · Casey ChanHoly Crap, This Passenger Train Totally Obliterated a FedEx TruckYesterday 8:47pm31910.5KSploid · Casey ChanWatch the World's First Double Backflip on a SnowmobileYesterday 7:46pmShareTweetNeed Help?Content GuidePermissionsPrivacyTerms of UseAdvertisingJobsRSS©2017 Gizmodo Media GroupKinja is in read-only mode.

picture of your plate. A team of MIT CSAIL researchers have developed an artificial intelligence system that has the potential to evolve into that kind of application. They call the AI Pic2Recipe, because it can predict the ingredients and recipe used to make a dish from a single snapshot. If that sounds familia, it's probably because of \"See Food,\" the fictional app that made an appearance in HBO's Silicon Valley, and a new-ish Pinterest feature that recognizes the most prominent ingredients in a picture of food.Other teams and institutions are also working on similar projects, and a common issue is the lack of samples that leads to limited accuracy. The team had to scour various social networks and websites, such as All Recipes and Food, to collect 1 million recipes. They then annotated the collection with more information about their ingredients and used the database to train a neural network.The result? Their system can identify ingredients like like flour, eggs and butter and can spit out the correct recipe for the dish in an image 65 percent of the time. CSAIL graduate student and lead author Nick Hynes explains:\"This could potentially help people figure out what's in their food when they don't have explicit nutritional information. For example, if you know what ingredients went into a dish but not the amount, you can take a photo, enter the ingredients, and run the model to find a similar recipe with known quantities, and then use that information to approximate your own meal.\"Before you can use it as part of your fitness regimen, though, the team still has to work on making it more accurate. They're also developing its ability to infer how a dish is prepared and to distinguish one ingredient from another. You can put the AI to the test yourself if you want -- just upload a pic on the team's demo website or click one of the available images.

permalinkGIF As we work towards crossing the uncanny valley so that computer-generated humans don’t look like horrific plastic mannequins, every last facial feature needs to be recreated perfectly. That even includes teeth, which can now be digitized using nothing but a video of someone smiling.AdvertisementPrevious methods used for creating believable CG teeth involved either modeling every last one from scratch, or using an intra-oral scanner to capture accurate digital copies which can be awkward and uncomfortable for a performer. What researchers at Disney Research Zurich, ETH Zurich, and the Max Planck Institute for Informatics have instead created is a non-invasive tool that can recreate a subject’s teeth by simply analyzing short videos, or even just photographs of their open mouth.Since most photographs and videos of a person don’t reveal every last tooth inside their mouths, the researchers developed a system that matches visible teeth to a catalog of existing tooth models, and then based on those matches, automatically generates the rest of the occluded teeth to match with appropriate sizes and shapes.The research could help streamline everything from the creation of visual-effect laden Hollywood blockbusters, to multi-million dollar video game franchises, making it easier and cheaper to create convincing computer-generated characters to either fool audiences, or just make an experience more immersive.Advertisement[Disney Research]Andrew LiszewskiandrewL@gizmodo.com@aliszewskiContributing EditorYou thought Disney only made cartoons and theme parks?

About VampiresRob Bricken23 minutes agoFiled to: prince lestatprince lestat and the realms of atlantisvampiresanne ricebooks321EditPromoteDismissUndismissShare to KinjaToggle Conversation toolsGo to permalinkWhen you think of vampires, chances are you think of Anne Rice’s Lestat—gothic, beautiful, tortured, romantic, everything that has practically defined the creatures in pop culture since Rice wrote Interview With the Vampire in 1976. But in her new book, the unusually titled Prince Lestat and the Realms of Atlantis (out today), Rice has shockingly redefined her own creation—and she told io9 why.AdvertisementAs I mentioned last week, I’ve been dying to talk about Realms of Atlantis because of how mind-boggling it is, but also how daring—even to me, someone who hadn’t read a Vampire Chronicles book in more than two decades. Honestly, in terms of how much it up-ends its own mythology, I’m hard-pressed to think of another spoiler that changes its universe more fundamentally. But I have to reveal it in order for the interview to make sense, so consider this an ultimate....Advertisement..Sorry, I really want to make sure no one who wants to avoid spoilers sees this.Sponsored..AdvertisementAdvertisement..Aliens. AdvertisementAliens have arrived in The Vampire Chronicles. Well, more specifically, they arrived thousands of years ago, but they are hugely responsible for the existence of all vampires, as well as Atlantis.Before Realms of Atlantis, Lestat and his brethren only knew that the vampire’s curse came to be when a bloodthirsty spirit named Amel possessed the ancient Egyptian queen Akasha (the titular Queen of the Damned). It is Amel’s spirit that can be passed from vampire to vampire, connecting them all, and giving vampires their powers and weaknesses. In Prince Lestat (2014), it’s discovered that Amel is still conscious in this neural vampire network, but primarily residing in the spiritual core of the vampires… which Lestat has absorbed after the defeat of Akasha.But Amel is not a spirit… at least not originally. As Realms reveals, he is also the founder of Atlantis, a coastal city of unbelievably advanced technology, around 10,000 years ago. The reason he’s so smart is because he was abducted by aliens named Bravennans, modified, and sent to Earth for reasons I won’t spoil. When he rebels the aliens destroy Atlantis, and Amel somehow becomes a spirit, but he also fuses with a special Atlantean technology that ends up forming the essence of everything that makes a vampire a vampire—an essence that can be measured and altered scientifically.AdvertisementAdvertisementI don’t expect everyone to like Rice’s massive, massive alteration to her mythos, but I genuinely enjoyed the book, and I loved the audacity of it. It was fascinating to see the classic, gothic world of Lestat suddenly, completely upended—but also to see the vampires engaging and embracing the modern world, forming a real community, and, most of all, discovering that their existence, which they once thought to be a divine curse, is actually the result of science—otherworldly science, but science all the same. (And guys? There are so many more surprises I didn’t spoil.)But all of this is preamble. Let Rice herself explain why the Realms of Atlantis contains these shocking revelations, why Rice thinks people shouldn’t be surprised, and what comes next for Lestat. (And check out the first part of our interview here.)                        $17                    Prince Lestat and the Realms of Atlantis: The Vampire ChroniclesFrom amazon35 purchased by readersGizmodo Media Group may get a commissionBuy nowio9: With Prince Lestat and the Realms of Atlantis, I think you may have invented the genre of gothic science-fiction.AdvertisementAnne Rice: I see what you mean. Well, I [started] all this with a great emphasis on gothic romance. I wanted these vampires to be dressed in black velvet, wearing white lace. I wanted them to be beautiful and seductive. I wanted them to be like the movie I saw as a child, called Dracula’s Daughter (1936). It involved this gothic, beautiful, sensitive, wonderful countess who was in fact the daughter of Dracula, and she was an artist living in London and it was a very romantic presentation of the vampire as a tortured soul. And I loved that. And that was where I was at in the beginning; I wanted these beautiful, irresistible tragic characters to appeal to the reader and for the reader to fall in love with them.But I have never seen science fiction as in any way anathema to this. Very early on, I did a signing in a science fiction bookstore in 1976, and those science fiction readers who came to that store, they took the vampires absolutely seriously. It was amazing. They walked in and they asked metaphysical questions about Louis’ quest for meaning. And I just had such respect for them.AdvertisementI’m very aware of this scifi world, [so I know] it dips a lot into—maybe not the gothic, but it tips into poetry. I mean, Robert Heinlein’s stories are just filled with poetry. Ray Bradbury is filled with poetic meaning. And it’s so—to me, there was always this reverence to science fiction. So I don’t have any fear of going there.My vampires are so real to me, their gothic allure is so well-established that I don’t feel in any way threatened by the hard cult science of science fiction. I go for the metaphysical and poetic side of science fiction. So, it’s exciting to me to work with both. It really is. And you know, I hope maybe some scifi readers will give this book a chance whereas maybe they weren’t interested in vampire fiction before.AdvertisementAre you worried that some fans might be put off on changing the vampires’ origin from something supernatural to something extraterrestrial?Rice: I’ve always been looking for that bottom line. I’m always going back to where it all started, and discovering more about “how” it started.This [continues] the process. It’s just digging back even further. Like, what was this entity that came to Akasha? What was it before? Where did it come from? And so to me it’s all very logical and it’s all of a piece.AdvertisementSomeone might be disappointed. They might have been hoping for a more religious or a more purely mysterious explanation, but I’ve never actually offered that to readers. I’ve always offered the biological reality for these palpable beings. They occupy space. They are subject to physical rules, just as we are.That, to me, is the great dramatic tension. They have to deal with physical limitations even though they appear to be supernatural. They aren’t. They’re preternatural. What we think of as the supernatural maybe isn’t supernatural at all. It’s not the abolition of everything we believe in the material world—it’s another dimension of the material world that we have yet to really fathom.AdvertisementEven beyond the big reveal about Atlantis and the aliens, the book doesn’t come close to answering all the mysteries in the series. Correct me if I’m wrong, but there are still ghosts, and there are spirits besides them, and their origin is still unknown. Rice: Where did the spirits come from? And the story of Amel—do we know the full truth? Or is there yet more to be discovered? Is Amel wrong about some of the things he thinks about himself and where he came from? Was Amel the victim of lies about himself?AdvertisementI’m always dealing with that idea of where the soul comes from. Can a droid have a soul, simply because of awareness? Can it generate a soul? Is a soul made of nanoparticles? All of that I think is important.But do you already know the answers to these mysteries? The origins of ghosts and spirits in your world?Rice: I have questions. My questions bump up against the reality that humans just don’t know. I mean, that’s something I live with at my age now, that I do not know what happens after death, if anything happens after death. I do not know and I can’t know and frankly I don’t believe people that tell me they know. So I don’t know that I can ever offer to the readers an absolute explanation for something as the real reason for why we’re here and where we came from—I don’t think that’s possible.AdvertisementBut I can certainly ask a lot of really interesting questions. And I can imagine a lot of very interesting beings based on what we know of ghosts, apparitions, possession and so forth.Are there any other details you can tell us about Lestat’s future, and/or the next book?AdvertisementRice: He’ll still be the prince and he’ll still be at the chateau and he will still have his closest confidants there. He will have Marius and Armand and Louis and Fareed and Gregory and he will confront yet another huge threat. And the threats that they’re confronting are coming out of the internet age. They’re confronting the fact that the internet age is enabling immortals and occult beings to come together as never before. It’s enabling them to find each other, it’s enabling them to talk to each other—so they’re confronting—the crises they’re confronting are modern crises. And I think that’s a thrilling idea.I like the idea of bringing all that charm and beauty and enchantment into the present time and fusing it with the modern challenges. And think of what the internet must mean to ghosts and spirits, my god. They can find each other. They can find other entities like themselves for whom they may have been divided for centuries.AdvertisementThat’s very much a theme in Prince Lestat, too. How is the internet impacting all of this? Little vampire Benjy is one of my favorite characters. He’s 12 years old when he’s made a vampire, and he’s a Bedouin from the nation of Israel. And he has a sense of tribe and a sense of tribal loyalties and he starts using the internet to reach other vampires and to talk to the whole world of vampires—and in a sense, he helps bring them together as a worldwide tribe. And that’s very much behind these books.Before the Atlantis reveal, I was shocked to see not just how much vampires had embraced the modern age, and how positively, but also how they’d formed an actual community together. It’s so different from the original books, but it’s also clearly a part of the original Vampire Chronicles.Rice: That’s true. There was a story unfolding about the past and now it’s the present, it goes even deeper into the past to find answers, but also to better live in the present. To better define themselves in the present. You know, in the past they sometimes got answers and they’re just left with despair, you know? The next Prince Lestat book, as I call them—the next one will also be named “Prince Lestat and...”—will also be a book where the past is seen entirely in the terms of the vigorous and vital existence of the present.AdvertisementDo you anticipate the next book or books containing a bombshell as world-changing as Realms of Atlantis has?Rice: I don’t know. I’m not sure. If other things open up as I’m writing, maybe so. The thing with me is to surrender. To surrender to where it goes. To establish the reality for myself—these characters exist, they’re really there, they’re talking to me—and to see where they’re taking me. And it’s possible there would be another bombshell.AdvertisementYou know, until you said that word, “bombshell,” I didn’t really see it that way. So I don’t know. I think the next one could perhaps be as radical. Would that be the word? Is it possible? It’s possible. What I don’t want to lose right now—and I never want to lose—is the court and Lestat as the prince as the community. I don’t want to lose that again. And I’m not going to risk it. I’ve done that in the past. I’ve risked it. I’ve thrown it away at the end of books. Because I had to! It didn’t sustain for me. It just didn’t. And I was so beaten up on by what happened in the book that I crawled out of the book and didn’t take anything positive with me. But that’s not the way it is now.Last question. I originally meant this to be a little silly, based on the unexpectedness of Atlantis, but after our discussion... could you envision a story in which Lestat went to the moon? AdvertisementRice: I wouldn’t rule it out. I might go in that direction. I wouldn’t say he’s going to the moon, necessarily, but… it could happen. This book has opened up the possibilities of extraterrestrial life. I wouldn’t rule it out. I want to see what happens.If there’s going to be an explanation of what happens to a vampire’s physiology in space, given that days and nights simply don’t exist, there’s no one better to answer that question than you. Rice: Well that’s great. That’s wonderful. I appreciate that very much. If I’ll have an answer, I don’t know...but I am very excited about getting into this [next] book. It’s too early to know for sure which way it’s going to go. I’ve got some ideas, I’ve got a map... but I don’t know where I’ll land.Anne Rice Reveals Why She Brought the Vampire Lestat to the Realms of AtlantisAnne Rice Reveals Why She Brought the Vampire Lestat to the Realms of AtlantisAnne Rice Reveals Why She Brought the…If you haven’t read Prince Lestat, Anne Rice’s most recent Vampire Chronicles book, a lot has…Read more Read moreRob Brickenrob.bricken@gizmodo.com@robbrickenRob Bricken is the Editor of io9, yo.Gear from Kinja DealsThe New \"World's Fastest\" Gaming MouseBestsellers: PlayStation PlusToday's Best Lifestyle Deals: Pajamas and Slippers, MAC Cosmetics, Extended Cyber Monday SalesReply32 repliesLeave a replyYou may also likeGizmodoReddit Is Tearing Itself ApartToday 10:20amThe SlotMelania Trump Threatens to Sue Over Barron Trump Video Made by Autistic Young Man39 minutes agoSploidSo How Close Do You Live to a Nuclear Bomb?Today 12:50pmRecent from Rob Bricken1323329.1Kio9 · Rob BrickenThe Big DC/CW Crossover Forgot to Begin Last NightToday 10:00am20703215.7Kio9 · Rob BrickenWhat the Hell Is The Walking Dead Even DoingYesterday 10:55am56426.2Kio9 · Rob BrickenAnne Rice Reveals Why She Brought the Vampire Lestat to the Realms of Atlantis11/22/16 4:27pmShareTweetAbout BlogNeed Help?Content GuideGizmodo StoreRedirecting to the Gizmodo store in  Disclaimer: You are leaving a Gizmodo Media Group, LLC website and going to a third party site, which is subject to its own privacy policy and terms of use.ContinuePermissionsPrivacyTerms of UseAdvertisingJobsRSS©2016 Gizmodo Media GroupKinja is in read-only mode.

SommelierPatrick Allan47 minutes agoFiled to: alcoholdrinksdrinkingwinechocolatecandydessertdessertsValentine's Dayvideos1EditPromoteShare to KinjaToggle Conversation toolsGo to permalinkThere’s nothing more romantic than wine and chocolate—as long as the pairing is right. Here are some useful suggestions from an expert in the field.In this video, Madeline Puckette, sommelier and founder of Wine Folly, shares her picks for great chocolate and wine pairings. For basic chocolates, especially the dark stuff, Puckette suggests a nice, sweet port. For chocolate cakes, cupcakes, and the like, reach for a bottle of shiraz. And if you’re more of a white chocolate fan—which isn’t really chocolate, but still—a dry sauvignon blanc will elevate the vanilla flavoring of the white chocolate to an irresistible fruitiness. Of course, if you’re reaching for the basic stuff in the candy aisle, there are plenty of other pairing suggestions out there.The Best Wine to Pair With Halloween CandyThe Best Wine to Pair With Halloween CandyThe Best Wine to Pair With Halloween CandyYou may be too old to trick-or-treat, but you can buy bags of whatever Halloween candy you desire…Read more Read moreChocolate and Wine Pairings | YouTubePatrick Allanpatrick.allan@lifehacker.com@mr_patrickallanStaff Writer, Lifehacker.comReplyLeave a replyYou may also likeThe SlotTrump Tried and Failed to Pull His Strange Trademark Handshake on Justin TrudeauToday 10:05amThe SlotOklahoma Lawmaker: Pregnant Women Are 'Hosts' Whose Bodies Don't Belong to ThemToday 10:50amThe ConcourseWe Must Regulate The Price of Stuff At Airports Because It Is Pure Extortion In ThereToday 2:46pmRecent from Patrick Allan122KLifehacker · Patrick AllanImprove Your Audio Recording Skills With This NPR Production GuideToday 2:30pm255.2KLifehacker · Patrick AllanMake Your Own Starbucks-Style Sous Vide Egg Bites at HomeToday 1:30pm715435.4KLifehacker · Patrick AllanHow to Get Your Neighbor’s Dog to Stop Barking IncessantlyToday 8:00amShareTweetAbout BlogNeed Help?Content GuideLifehacker StoreRedirecting to the Lifehacker store in  Disclaimer: You are leaving a Gizmodo Media Group, LLC website and going to a third party site, which is subject to its own privacy policy and terms of use.ContinuePermissionsPrivacyTerms of UseAdvertisingJobsRSS©2017 Gizmodo Media GroupKinja is in read-only mode.

DOA gizmodoDeadspinGizmodoJalopnikJezebelKotakuLifehackerSploidPaleofutureio9ScienceReviewsField GuideMy New $2,500 MacBook Pro Was DOA Alex Cranz33 minutes agoFiled to: AppleMacBook Procrash report12EditPromoteDismissUndismissShare to KinjaToggle Conversation toolsGo to permalinkImage: Alex Cranz/GizmodoDamn this new MacBook Pro. As of this very moment I’ve had the new 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar for just a few hours. It’s small, sturdy, and typing my password in was pleasant enough. That Touch Bar looks really neat too, and when I set up Touch ID to login from the Touch Bar, I felt like I was in the future.AdvertisementBut $2,500 worth of overpriced, hyper-engineered Apple laptop has now crashed 23 times—a full dozen in the first hour I had this thing.The last 11 crashes occurred more sporadically because I spent the last hour and a half on three different calls with Apple in an effort to resolve the problem. I will say that the company’s tech support personnel were very kind and contacting them was easy. You sign in to your Apple account on the support website, answer a question, and a call is scheduled. The website had me run a few tests while Apple sets up the call, then your phone rings, and there’s a gracious member of tech support on the line.AdvertisementThe first representative guided me through resetting my PRAM and arranged a callback. The computer crashed. Rep Two had me reinstall the OS. The computer crashed. Rep Three saw the detailed notes and immediately said I needed to speak to a MacBook Supervisor (whatever that is). I was then placed on hold for ten minutes. The MacBook Supervisor took one look at the issue and put me in contact with the internet sales team.So tomorrow I will pack up my brand new MacBook Pro. It will not be hard, apart from keeping the device stable enough to remove all my personal information. The charger never even came out of its wrapper. The box is still sitting on top of its packaging on my bed, cellophane shining. I’ll get a new MacBook Pro eventually. First, I have to ship Apple the old and wait for FedEx to tell Apple I’ve shipped it. Then Apple will “start building” me a new one. There is no guarantee of a ship date. Maybe December. Maybe earlier.SponsoredThis is standard operating procedure for Apple, and it makes sense for a company that deals in millions of phones every year. But a $2,500 “custom built” laptop is a far cry from a $600 smartphone. The expectations are higher for that customer base. We expect things like a device that works out of the box—particularly when it’s supposedly “custom built.” If I’m spending $2,500, and they’re specially installing RAM and an i7 processor is it really too much to ask that they test the damn thing before it leaves the factory? There are plenty of smaller companies with cheaper products that do just that. Once upon a time the splurging for an Apple product felt worth it. You were paying for an outstanding operating system and a breezy computing experience, as well as the best tech support in the game. A new computer would have been shipped the moment the return label was created for the old one. Or they might have even encouraged a visit to an Apple Store, where a tech would have been able to physically repair the issue.AdvertisementAdvertisementInstead, my new “custom built” laptop arrived DOA. I’m not the only one with problems, either. While the new 13-inch MacBook Pro only started arriving in users’ hands today, the 15-inch had a few days head start, and numerous owners have flocked to the MacRumors forum to crow about “GPUGate.” Those fancy and woefully underpowered video cards? Are creating some massive glitches on the display. Are you suffering from GPUGate? Did your shiny new laptop also come DOA? Shoot me an email at alex.cranz@gizmodo.com. I’d love to hear more.Alex Cranzalex.cranz@gizmodo.com@alexhcranzReviews Editor. Trained her dog to do fist bumps.

managementstreamingofflinefeatureeditor's picks162EditPromoteShare to KinjaToggle Conversation toolsGo to permalinkRejoice, you can download Netflix movies and TV shows to watch offline. Unfortunately, it only downloads to your built-in storage by default, which can lead to some slow, cluttered phones. If you’d rather use the extra space on your SD card for all those Stranger Things episodes, here’s how.Method #1: Copy Everything to Your SD Card ManuallyYou’ll need to label them yourself, but you can copy Netflix videos easily.The safest way to copy Netflix videos to your SD card is also the most tedious. When Netflix downloads a movie, it’s stored in a nondescript folder on your phone’s built-in storage. You can copy these to your SD card temporarily to save space, but you’ll need to copy them back whenever you want to watch them. Still, it’s a handy way to store extra movies or shows for later, like a long flight or car trip when you’ll have nothing else to do. AdvertisementWhen you download movies or TV shows to your phone, the files on your device won’t have descriptive names, so you’re not going to get BojackHorseman_S01_E01 or anything. Instead, you’ll see a folder with a long, seemingly-random number. If you want to keep a tidy, organized library, download one episode or movie at a time and follow these steps:Open your preferred file manager (we recommend Solid Explorer.)Turn on the option to show hidden files and folders, if you haven’t already. (To do this in Solid Explorer, tap the menu button while browsing, tap “Folder options” then check “Show hidden files.”)Navigate to Device Storage > Android > data > com.netflix.mediaclient > files > Download > .ofHere you’ll see a folder named with a string of numbers. Long-press the folder and tap the scissors icon to cut it to the clipboard.Slide out the left-hand panel in Solid Explorer and tap your SD card. Navigate to the folder you want to store the files in. Tap the circular clipboard icon in the lower-right corner to paste the files.Rename the numbered Netflix folder to add the name of the movie or TV show you just downloaded to the end, but do not delete the number. You’ll need this later.When you want to watch your movie or TV show again, copy the folder back to its original location in step 3. Delete the label you added earlier so only the number remains.If you rename or change any of the files in the .of folder, Netflix won’t recognize or play them. You can add labels while you store them on your SD card temporarily, but you’ll need to put every file and folder back where you found it with exactly the same names. Admittedly, this process is cumbersom—and Netflix might issue an update that blocks it entirely—but it does allow you to store a lot more downloads than you can fit on your internal storage.AdvertisementIf you have an OTG cable—like this one you can buy for less than $5—you can use this same process to store files on flash drives or even external hard drives. If you’re going to go this route, though, your drive will need to use the exFAT file system. If you’re not familiar with it, we explain what it is and how to use it here. This isn’t exactly a convenient way to store movies, but if you already have a properly formatted drive and you want to save some shows for a road trip, this is a handy workaround.Method #2: Set Up Your SD Card As Shared StorageIt’s a bit like your phone and SD card are getting married.Technically, Netflix stores downloaded movies on what’s called your “primary shared storage.” By default, that means your phone’s built-in storage, but you can let your phone “adopt” an SD card to make that space even bigger.There are a few downsides to this method. First, this will reformat your SD card. Before you proceed, you’ll need to back up anything that’s on your SD card. If you’ve already installed apps to your SD card, you should move them back to your phone’s storage for now and back up any data (like photos) in those apps that you can’t recover later. Ideally, you’d follow these steps with a fresh SD card.SponsoredSecond, this can slow your whole phone down if you’re using a slow SD card. Internal storage is faster than some SD cards. When you force apps to install on the card, you can make them slower to launch or run because it takes longer to read that data. Make sure you’re using a fast SD card (like a Class 6 card) if you don’t want to take a performance hit.Finally, once you adopt an SD card, you should never remove it. Android will treat your SD card like it’s part of your phone’s built-in storage space. That means important files will be stored on your card and you can break things if you remove it. If you go this route, be prepared to treat that SD card like it can’t be removed from your phone.AdvertisementAdvertisementAll that said, to turn your SD card into adopted storage, follow these steps:Insert your SD card into your device. If it’s already inserted, remove it then reinsert it.A notification will appear indicating a new drive is detected. Tap “Set Up” in this notification.Tap “Use as internal storage.” This step will erase the SD card.You’ll now be prompted to move extra data to your new storage. You can do this now, or do it later under Settings > Storage > SD Card > Migrate DataYou can choose to do step 4 later, but you’ll probably want to do it before downloading Netflix movies and TV shows. After you adopt the SD card into your built-in storage, Android will treat it like one big drive. All your apps will start using the space on your SD card seamlessly, including Netflix.

Is. So. Cool.AdvertisementVariety is reporting that Peter Dinklage, best known for his starring role as Tyrion Lannister on Game of Thrones, is in talks to join 2018's Avengers: Infinity War as well as its 2019 untitled sequel.There’s no word on who the actor could play, but it won’t be his first go around in the Marvel universe. He played Bolivar Trask in X-Men: Days of Future Past, a film that doesn’t connect with the MCU.AdvertisementDinklage will be finished with his Game of Thrones shooting by the time Infinity War goes into production, which is expected to be in the next several weeks.The film, which opens May 4, 2018, will be directed by the Russo Brothers. Almost every character who has previously appeared in, and survived, a MCU movie up until this point is expected to be in it, many of whom will battle Thanos, played by Josh Brolin. Then there will be a sequel—Avengers 4 if you will—on May 3, 2019.Speculate wildly about Dinklage’s potential role below.Sponsored[Variety]Germain Lussiergermain.lussier@gizmodo.com@GermainLussierEntertainment Reporter for io9/GizmodoMore MarvelThe Best Comics for Fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe    Crossbones Will Not Return to the MCU—But It Was Consideredio9 Roundtable: What Does Civil War Mean for the Future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe?Gear from Kinja DealsBestsellers: HGST Touro S 1TB 7200RPM Portable DriveLogitech G502 Proteus Core: The Gaming Mouse To BeatSign Up For a $12 Humble Membership, Get a Copy of XCOM 2 ImmediatelyReply208 repliesLeave a replyYou may also likeio9Two More Heroes Are Showing Up in Avengers: Infinity War Yesterday 9:08amio9Something Weird's Happening With the Cast of Pacific Rim 2Tuesday 9:00amio9This Video May Show Alternate Death Scenes for Rogue One Characters Yesterday 5:17pmRecent from Germain Lussier513821.6Kio9 · Germain LussierDisney May Have Found Its Next Santa Claus: Anna KendrickYesterday 7:50pm64746.5Kio9 · Germain LussierThis Video May Show Alternate Death Scenes for Rogue One Characters Yesterday 5:17pm68510.4Kio9 · Germain LussierWill Smith Might Star in Tim Burton's Dumbo, and No, This Is Not a JokeYesterday 3:46pmShareTweetAbout BlogNeed Help?Content GuideGizmodo StoreRedirecting to the Gizmodo store in  Disclaimer: You are leaving a Gizmodo Media Group, LLC website and going to a third party site, which is subject to its own privacy policy and terms of use.ContinuePermissionsPrivacyTerms of UseAdvertisingJobsRSS©2017 Gizmodo Media GroupKinja is in read-only mode.

ReadingFingerprints6EditPromoteShare to KinjaToggle Conversation toolsGo to permalinkDespite being the most common way to protect computers and sensitive data, passwords are a terrible security solution. So scientists at Hong Kong Baptist University are teaching computers to read a user’s lips as a far more secure method of biometric security.AdvertisementChoosing a password that’s both unique enough to be secure and simple enough to remember is getting harder and harder. That’s why many laptops and smartphones include fingerprint readers for an added layer of biometric security. However, faking fingerprints is easier than you might think, so Cheung Yiu-ming, a professor at the university’s computer science department, wants computers and smartphones to use the unique movements of a user’s lips while they say their password as another layer of authentication.The feature would only work on devices with a user-facing camera, but it would offer advantages over voice-based authentication, which can be tripped up by background noise and other sounds, is often language-specific, and simply doesn’t work for those with a speech impairment. The lip-reading approach, which tracks lip shape, movement, and even texture, could be used almost anywhere. It would also be virtually impossible for someone else to mimic, as those qualities are unique to every user.AdvertisementThe new approach would still require a user to remember a spoken passphrase, which would be hard to keep secret given this technology is proposed for use with ATMs and other machines that reside in very public places. But even if someone overhears what you’ve said, it should be impossible for them to fool a device—unless they happen to be your twin.[Hong Kong Baptist University via New Atlas]That fingerprint reader isn't as secure as you think    How to Easily Hack a Smartphone With an Inkjet Printer and Conductive InkHackers Reproduce A German Politician's Fingerprint From Photos    These Fake Fingerprint Stickers Let You Access a Protected Phone While Wearing GlovesAndrew LiszewskiandrewL@gizmodo.com@aliszewskiContributing EditorReply6 repliesLeave a replyYou may also likeThe SlotHere Are Some Photographs of Donald Trump's Face and HandYesterday 6:17pmLifehackerWhat I’ve Learned From Tinkering With the Raspberry Pi for Five YearsToday 9:50amThe RootTrans Women Are Women.

Company, Tries Pulling a Reverse Musk™Matt Novak11 minutes agoFiled to: richard bransonvirgin galacticreverse muskvirgin to KinjaToggle Conversation toolsGo to permalinkRichard Branson at a mental health conference in April 2016 (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)“I hope in five years a reusable rocket will have been developed which can take up to 10 people at a time to stay at the Virgin Hotel for two weeks,” Richard Branson proudly announced back in still waiting on Branson’s Virgin Galactic to take tourists into space, despite the promises of the past two decades that he would do just that. But Branson has a new idea for the meantime: Why not launch small satellites into space? Called Virgin Orbit, Branson’s newest space venture will be led by former Boeing executive Dan Hart. “By offering low cost and frequent service to space, the team is revolutionizing the small satellite market within the promising space economy,” Branson bragged on his space strategy, however, is a little odd, so we’ve come up with a name for it: The Reverse Musk™. How do you pull off a Reverse Musk™? You start with the really hard stuff and then give up and try the more humble projects you should’ve been working on two decades ago. Elon Musk founded SpaceX in 2002 with bold dreams of eventually propelling humans into space—to Mars and beyond. But Musk realized that you had to start with the more modest stuff. Over the next decade, SpaceX built rockets and sent capsules to the International Space Station, and launched satellites. And all of those things paid off. Musk now talks about how he wants to send space tourists around the moon by the end of 2018. And even though it’s a tremendously ambitious goal, some people believe he can do it. Why? Musk started with the “smaller” stuff like launching satellites. Getting humans to the moon and Mars may have been the ultimate goal, but Musk clearly knew that you had to learn to walk before you could run. SponsoredBranson has always been about the opposite. Yes, he’s been developing his own rockets, and spaceships—one that tragically and infamously exploded in 2014, killing a pilot. But he only recently pursued private contracts to do the more modest stuff, like launching satellites into space, that ultimately teaches lessons that you can use for manned space travel. Branson did, however, get the state of New Mexico to pay $250 million for a spaceship graveyard. So it’s not like he wasn’t busy spending other people’s money. Just not in a way that benefited very many has been my longheld dream to open access to space to change the world for good,” Branson said in a statement about his new company. “We have been striving to do that by manufacturing vehicles of the future, enabling the small satellite revolution, and preparing commercial space flight for many more humans to reach space and see our home planet. ”“I’m thrilled that our small satellite launch service has now progressed to the point it merits the formation of its own company, Virgin Orbit, and a new president in Dan with decades of deep experience and success in a broad variety of space programs. ”Will Virgin Orbit be successful? Hopefully. But it’s really something he should’ve started with back in the Galactic officials said 100 people already have paid $200,000 apiece to fly into space,” a story from the Associated Press in 2005 promised. “They include actress Victoria Principal, who told the news conference she looked forward to being on the first civilian flight of Virgin Galactic, perhaps as soon as 2008. ”Like we said, we’re still rooting for Branson’s The Reverse Musk™, even if he has almost 20 years of failed promises in his wake. Hopefully this one takes off. Do you get it? I said, I hope this one takes off. Like the spaceships. They take off.

Poppy Seeds Probably Aren't Going to Make You Fail a Drug CentsVitalsApp directoryGearNo, Poppy Seeds Probably Aren't Going to Make You Fail a Drug TestPatrick Allan31 minutes agoFiled to: sciencebody sciencefoodpoppy to KinjaToggle Conversation toolsGo to permalinkTales of poppy seed-covered foods being the cause of failed drug tests is a classic urban legend that’s been floating around since a certain episode of Seinfeld. While there may be some truth behind the myth, poppy seeds aren’t likely to ruin your drug test this video from the SciShow YouTube channel, Olivia Gordon explains the science of poppy seeds, opiates, and typical drug screening tests. If you weren’t aware, morphine and other opiates come from the same plant as poppy seeds: Papaver somniferum, or the opium poppy. So, it’s possible that poppy seeds—like you’d find on a bagel or in a muffin—carry the same chemical components as the opiates drug tests typically look for. However, the truth is the trace amounts of opiates that may have ended up on those poppy seeds don’t come anywhere close to the amount in an actual dose of morphine or other hard opiates. Urine tests are pretty sensitive, and those poppy seeds from your breakfast might show up, but it won’t be enough to raise a red flag. Furthermore, the threshold for opiates found in urine was raised back in the early 2000s from . 3 micrograms per milliliter to 2 micrograms per milliliter, which is a massive gap. If you’re really worried about it, avoid consuming poppy seeds for a few days before your test. But don’t sweat it if you had a tasty poppy seed muffin that morning either.

Hardawar/AOLsave Saveshare Grab an Amazon Echo for half off todayYou can also pick up the Echo Dot for $35 and the Tap for $80. Swapna Krishna, @skrishna 24m ago in HomeComments Hardawar/AOLAmazon's been expanding its line of smart, Alexa-powered home speakers for awhile now. If you're interested in buying an Amazon Echo, well then today is your lucky day. The smart speaker, which usually is priced at $180, is on sale for just $90 at select retailers today. You can also grab an Amazon Echo Dot for $35, a $15 discount off its regular price of $50, and an Amazon Tap for $80, discounted from the regular price of $130. It's strange that these devices would be on sale at third-party stores and not Amazon itself (not only is the Echo showing as full price, but it's out of stock, with an estimated ship date of August 11. However, you can pick up a discounted device at stores such as Bed Bath & Beyond, Best Buy and Bloomingdale's. We've seen sales on the Echo before, but this seems to be the steepest discount yet. If you want to take advantage of this offer, make sure you grab one before midnight tonight, Central time.

Jamie Rigg, @jmerigg 55m ago in MobileComments own-brand devices have been hit and miss over the past few years. There was the Smart Ultra 6, which was one of the best affordable phones of its time, and the Smart Platinum 7, which was an interesting step into more expensive, sub-flagship category. But alongside those, there have been a number of humdrum handsets that failed to impress. As per its yearly update cycle, Vodafone recently released new own-brand hardware, with the Smart V8 in particular slotting into the carrier's roster as one of the best affordable options. Gallery: Vodafone Smart V8 | 16 Photos 16 +12 The most immediately striking feature of the Smart V8 when you free it from its box is the build quality. It's almost entirely brushed metal aside from two pockets of textured plastic, with neatly chamfered edges and loudspeaker grilles. While it's not pushing the boundaries of design by any means, it certainly looks and feels like it's punching above the £159 pay-as-you-go price point. The spec sheet isn't to be taken lightly either. You're looking at a 5. 5-inch, 1080p LCD display, an octa-core 1. 4GHz Snapdragon 435, 3 gigs of RAM, 32GB of expandable storage, a 16-megapixel primary camera and 8MP front-facer, all powered by a decent-sized 3,000mAh battery. You also get a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor and NFC chip -- hello Android Pay. Perhaps even more important, the Smart V8 is running Android 7. 1. 1, so it's basically as up-to-date as you can get on the software front. It's more or less the stock Android experience, albeit with a few borderline-bloatware apps from Vodafone added in. One quirk I've discovered worth noting is I can't seem to resize widgets on the homescreen. Not a huge deal, but it does mean the digital clock widget is naturally off-centre, which is slightly irritating. In sunny summer conditions, the 16MP camera can be pretty handy. Good colour saturation, clarity, and contrast thanks to the HDR mode. The app is pretty busy with filters and features and settings, from full manual control to long exposure and \"active photo\" modes (kinda like GIFs/Live Photos). You won't find much help in them in low-light conditions, though, where the camera begins to fall off fairly quickly. Gallery: Vodafone Smart V8 camera samples | 13 Photos 13 +9 All in all, there's nothing particularly special about the Smart V8. These days, metalwork, this kind of spec sheet and value-added features like fingerprint sensor and NFC are becoming standard at the mid-to-low end. The new handset does have something going for it, though -- a pretty competitive price tag. Vodafone's pay-as-you-go range is relatively sparse around the £150 mark. You've got the £149 Sony Xperia L1, which is less attractive enough on paper to justify the jump to the £159 Smart V8. The closest handset beyond that point is the fairly comparable £199 Huawei P8 lite (2017). The Moto G5 gets a nod too, obviously, as well as the Wileyfox Swift 2, since they can be bought elsewhere for bang on £159. You wouldn't say either of them are significantly better than the Smart V8, though. Smart N8If you've set yourself a slightly tighter budget, Vodafone also recently launched the Smart N8, an £85 handset sitting in the crowded low-end of the pay-as-you-go spectrum. It's more than appropriately specced, with a 5-inch, 720p display, quad-core 1. 3GHz MediaTek chip, 1. 5GB of RAM, 16 gigs of expandable storage, 13- and 5-megapixel cameras, fingerprint sensor, NFC and 2,400mAh battery. Despite looking a little on the drab side, it's a decent value device. You could always save yourself a London pint and opt for the £79 Moto G4 Play instead, which recently began receiving Android Nougat, but you would be sacrificing the fingerprint reader/NFC combo. But that's true of most other devices dipping below the £100 marker at the moment. Smart Tab N8While the two smartphones have obvious places in Vodafone's backroom, the new Smart Tab N8 is where things get confusing. The draw of pretty much all own-brand tablets is ultimate portability, thanks to 4G, at a reasonable cost. I wouldn't call the Smart Tab N8 very portable though, because it's massive. It's not that heavy at 465g and it's pretty thin, too, with 8. 95mm between the glass front and textured, tactile plastic back -- it's that it's all face. Gallery: Vodafone Smart Tab N8 | 9 Photos 9 +5 Not only does the slate carry a 10. 1-inch display, but a significant bloating of bezel around it. It's not something you could slip into a handbag and it not be a nuisance, let's say. Worse yet, that 10. 1-inch screen runs at a very noticeable 1,280 x 800 resolution, making it easy to pick out individual pixels. Large tablets are typically geared more towards entertainment, but 149 ppi doesn't really cut it nowadays. The other specs are largely irrelevant: A quad-core 1. 1GHz MediaTek processor, 2 gigs of RAM, 16GB of expandable storage, 4,600mAh battery and 5MP/2MP cameras on the appropriate sides. Vodafone is selling the Smart Tab N8 on contracts starting at £16 per month for a 5GB data cap and no upfront payment. I'd sooner get exactly the same plan with Samsung's 10. 1-inch Galaxy Tab A (2016), since it's been upgraded to Nougat already and waves a more alluring spec sheet, the 1,920 x 1,200 display being the most important upgrade. Hits and misses for Vodafone again, it would appear.

Apple’s Lisa Jackson to talk about the environmental and social role of tech companies at Disrupt SFPosted 1 hour ago by Romain Dillet StoryA race is underway to repair our hearing — with medicineThe tech industry has become so big that it now plays a much bigger role than just enabling productivity and fostering economic growth. Apple VP of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives Lisa Jackson knows this perfectly well as she’s responsible for making sure that Apple doesn’t make any compromise in favor of unrestrained growth. That’s why we’re excited to talk with Lisa Jackson on stage at Disrupt SF 2017 about the other side of tech. Jackson’s role at Apple encompasses so many different things. She’s the one responsible for minimizing Apple’s impact on the environment. Apple is building data centers that run 100 percent on renewable energy. But it is also concerned about the impact of its retail stores and offices. Apple also sells tens of millions of devices every quarter. The company needs to make sure that it comes in tiny packages so that it uses fewer planes, boats and trucks. And those packages are made out of paper. The company is trying to protect forests used in the production of paper packaging for Apple items. The company doesn’t want to mine the Earth until there’s no resources left. Apple is trying to use recycled material as much as possible in order to protect the Earth. And of course, Apple is trying to get back and recycle as many broken or unused devices at the end of their life cycle as possible. Apple is not perfect and it definitely feels like a work in progress, but Apple is also communicating a lot on those issues and regularly sharing updates about their various environmental projects. And protecting the Earth is just one aspect. Jackson is also trying to protect human rights and looking at Apple’s social impact. That’s why Apple stopped relying on cobalt from Congo after learning about child labor. The company is working with so many different suppliers that it needs to implement strong processes to find out if everyone is paid fairly under acceptable working conditions. Social issues aren’t limited to factories overseas. Tech companies have a responsibility when it comes to hiring and promoting a diverse pool of talent. That’s why Apple appointed its first-ever VP of Diversity and Inclusion Denise Young Smith earlier this year. And finally, Apple and other tech companies have become so big that they have a responsibility when it comes to policy changes. Everybody remembers the San Bernardino encryption case — Apple took a strong stance against the FBI and in favor of privacy. Under President Donald Trump’s administration, Silicon Valley leaders often strongly disagree with some of his decisions or tweets. It’s going to be interesting to discuss how Silicon Valley can have a say in those decisions.

Image: Chomp EaterySan Francisco is a city of long lines, and on a Saturday afternoon few lines here are longer than the one in front of the Chocolate Chair in Japantown. The Chocolate Chair’s specialty is Dragon’s Breath, neon-colored balls of puffed rice cereal soaked in liquid nitrogen. When you take a bite, the nitrogen-infusion fills your mouth with a dense, smoke-like gas. Breathe the gas out through your nose or mouth, and voilà, man becomes popularity is not due to its taste. Dragon’s Breath is, in fact, kind of disgusting. When fresh, it tastes kind of like fruit loops, but most of the time Dragon’s Breath is served stale, its taste more reminiscent of cardboard. The appeal comes instead from its aesthetics. Walk by its corner of the mall on any given day and you’ll find it surrounded by throngs of smartphone photographers. It is the food that launched a thousand Instagrams. With the right aesthetic, food can now go viral: Dragon’s Breath, ice cream logs, the rainbow grilled cheese, the raindrop cake. These foods are designed to be filtered. In the age of Instagram, the way food looks is more important than how it Chocolate Chair is a typical viral food success story. It got its start selling ice cream made with liquid nitrogen a few years ago before its L. A. outlet debuted Dragon’s Breath last spring. Thanks to a catchy name and visual effects, thousands of Instagram posts and a flurry of press coverage followed. No one said it was good, but it didn’t matter. Because damn does it make for a good Instagram selfie. Makeup looks are now designed to look better on Instagram than they do IRL. The same thing is happening to our grilled cheese topped with sprinkles swept our social media feeds this year, but the idea of actually eating it is mildly nauseating. Black Tap Burger & Beer in New York famously serves a gut-buster milkshake with toppings such as a whole slice of cake, but more people want to take a photo with it than finish it. The Raindrop Cake, made to look like a beautiful over-sized bead of water, reportedly tastes like literally nothing. In the age of Instagram, the way food looks is more important than how it tastes. And yet, there are thousands of posts, dozens of hashtags devoted to these foods and countless fawning news stories devoted to these foods. Black Tap’s milkshakes rocketed it from an unknown NYC burger joint to bi-coastal acclaim. The Raindrop Cake, a weekend pop-up started by an advertising guy, has been so successful that its creator recently quit his day job to focus on making tasteless gelatinous cakes full-time. “Food has become an accessible status symbol,” said food futurist Anna the last year or two, she told me, she’s noticed a significant uptick in foods that are popular for reasons besides taste. “It’s something that we’ve been seeing across categories—in food, fashion, makeup. It’s the popularization of these looks that are just designed to be photographed for Instagram,” she said. “People will wait in line for hours just to get a photo of a Black Tap milkshake. You put in the time and effort to wait in line and get the shot. And then people want the validation of the likes and comments. ”“Food has become an accessible status symbol. ” Pretty food, of course, is not new. Throughout history—and especially among the upper crust—certain dishes have proven popular mainly because of their elaborate presentations. In the 19th Century, Mrs. Beeton’s Book of Household Management suggested that the Victorian middle class arrange their salads to look like elaborate cakes. The Victorians were also obsessed with jellies, a gastronomic craze more about wobbling, high-stacked spectacle than taste. Victorian salad arrangement advice.

Back in 2014, the New York Times food critic Pete Wells coined this “camera cuisine,” noting that at high-end eateries in particular, its rise seemed intrinsically linked to a decline in side effect of the digital age in food photography, camera cuisine is any dish that was inspired by a picture or aspires to be one,” he wrote. “Like any genre of cooking, camera cuisine varies widely in quality, but in its purest form it is both exquisitely photogenic and peculiarly bland and lifeless. ”What’s new, Griggs told me, is that this obsession with a meal’s aesthetics has now filtered into mass culture. The fixation has in turn prompted purveyors of food to cater to Instagram’s foodie set. At the top of its menu, New York City’s Empellón include a message noting that “Empellón strongly discourages the use of cellphones, unless you’re posting food porn on Instagram. #Empellon. ” Several times, I’ve seen restaurant chefs spot a food-photographing diner and pull them into a spot with better lighting and restaurants now dole out free meals to Instagram “influencers” for a shot at going viral. A New York Times review can still make or break a restaurant, but now so can Instagram. Remember when Martha Stewart tweeted a photo of a wedge salad she had made and was immediately shamed by Twitter for its less than desirable aesthetic? Griggs recounted for me her experience with rolled ice cream as loved watching it being made, and then I was just so disappointed,” she said. “I would have been so much happier with an ice cream cone. ”Already, the pretty-food movement has inspired satire and ridicule. This summer, Ikea ran a popular ad campaign mocking Instagramming your food by imagining how it would have ruined 18th century meals. Man Repeller spoofed Instagram food porn by going on the “Instagram Foodie Diet” for a day, and then barfing. The truth is, ugly food is still delicious and the rise of pretty, gross food has begun to spur a divergent ugly food movement. The subreddit “Shitty Food Porn” collects images of food people are eating that they would only share with the anonymous it’s okay, though, to value food more for how it looks than how it tastes. Darren Wong, the proprietor of the Raindrop Cake, rejects the premise that food even needs to be about taste. His Raindrop Cake, made from a gelatin-like substance called agar, was inspired by mizu shingen mochi, a Japanese dessert he discovered online. “The cake itself is really about texture,” he told me. “For most people with an American palate, taste is the most important thing. But in many Asian dishes, the dish is really built around texture. I didn’t approach this as a food item. I approached it as an experience. It doesn’t matter what it tastes went to Japan and studied the dessert, then spent months trying to create a cake that almost perfectly resembled an oversized raindrop, a cake that would be like eating water. He debuted it at Smorgasborg in Brooklyn last March to much acclaim. Wong credits social media, and in particular Instagram, almost entirely for its success. Food, though, has always been about more than just the taste of what we put in how mouths. We also value the atmosphere of a restaurant, or the company of family and friends. Maybe Instagram has just shown us another way to enjoy food—taking in not just how it looks, but the social media conversation those aesthetics spur. “I did think a lot about visuals when I launched it,” Wong told me. “The majority of my customers, the first thing they do before taking a bite is take a photo. ”Kristen V.

This 32-year-old state senator is trying to get patent trolls out of MassachusettsPosted 51 minutes ago by Connie Loizos (@cookie)0SHARESNext StoryMicrosoft’s Path Guide is an unconventional approach to indoor navigationWhen the internet security company Cloudflare decided to engage in all-out war with what it calls a “dangerous new breed of patent troll,” it found a receptive audience with Eric Lesser, who became the youngest state senator in Massachusetts when elected to office in 2014. Senator Lesser, now a 32-year-old in his second two-year-term, was in the same Harvard fraternity as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, but says he didn’t really think much about tech until after working on President Obama’s first presidential election campaign in 2007. “I was traveling around with him and carrying suitcases and handling logistics for his traveling team,” he explains. When the campaign was over, he joined then-senior advisor David Axelrod at the White House as a special assistant; he also became involved with the Council of Economic Advisors and more specifically with the agency’s chairman at the time, economist Austan Goolsbee. “That’s really when I started to get exposure to a lot of tech policy and some of the issues,” he says. Fast-forward and today, among the issues Senator Lesser has become most focused on — because he sees it as among the bigger threats to Massachusetts’s economy — is patent trolling. Indeed, while he’s not sure how much he can do to help Cloudflare, which has a Boston office, a bill that Senator Lesser helped craft will be heard in committee next Tuesday, and it would put a serious crimp in what he calls “shakedown operations” more broadly. More from a conversation we had this morning, edited for length:TC: You’re on the young side to be a state senator. EL: I’d gone to Harvard, then Harvard Law School, and in my third year, I decided to jump into a race in the community where I grew up, and I won. It was a five-way primary, and very close. I think I won by 192 votes out of around 17,000. [Laughs. ]TC: When did you zero in on this patent problem? EL: In Massachusetts, you serve two-year terms, and after I was reelected to my second term, a friend who I was friendly with in college was at HBS and he sort of said, “There’s this thing that’s starting to create real issues,” and it was patent trolling. I’d had a very atmospheric knowledge of it from law school and IP classes, but I began realizing this was a very big deal. TC: How did you get started on your related work? EL: My friend first connected me with Eric Paley of [the venture firm] Founder Collective, and his wife, Shirley, who’s an IP lawyer and so knows this stuff well. Turns out there was a bill in Massachusetts that had been hanging around a while, authored by Anthony Petruccelli, who was a state senator who has since taken a job in the private sector. So we picked it up last year and attached it to an economic development bill, and the response to it was overwhelming. TC: But you didn’t get it through your state’s legislature. EL: We didn’t. So we reached out to the tech and legal community to better understand the ins and outs of what we wanted to propose, and we crafted a new bill — the one that will be heard on Tuesday [by the Joint Committee on Consumer Protection and Professional Licensure]. It’s just the second or third inning of this process. The bills — and there are two other patent bills, as well — will be heard on Tuesday. After that, the committee will begin the process of analyzing them and providing recommendations. Then they’re off, potentially, to the floor of both the House and the Senate. TC: When? In the fall? Early next year? EL: It’s hard to tell when that would happen. But everyone is up for reelection in November 2018, so before then, because the whole process starts anew afterward, with a new Senate and House that comes in. TC: Yikes. Is it good news or bad for you that there are two bills dealing with patent trolls? EL: It’s good. It’s a level of the indication of interest and hopefully shows that a lot of members of legislature are involved in this. It also helps create buzz and momentum. I think all of us understand that there is a need to strongly protect intellectual property and show zero tolerance for anyone copying IP. But what we’re seeing is a really vicious and cyclical process where, for profit, people are bullying and scaring young entrepreneurs. You hear about the three or four kids in a dorm room who are tinkering around with an idea, then suddenly, they get slammed with one of these completely vague cease-and-desist letters from a place they’ve never heard of, citing patents they didn’t know existed. The threat is: turn over everything you’re doing to us, or pay us $30,000. TC: Cloudflare is particularly concerned with the growth of non-practicing entities that are started by former IP litigators, because they can buy up unused patents on the cheap, then, using their law degrees, easily and affordably put the screws to companies with those patents. Are you trying to outlaw these firms specifically? EL: It’s a little further afield from where we are today, but not entirely. The way we’ve delineated it is, if you’re involved in R&D or manufacturing or you’re a hospital or a university or a business — basically, if you a real entity — then this bill is likely not going to apply to you. We’re trying with some specificity to zero in on these non-practicing entities, so it would include the [Cloudflare] situation and other patent trolls that we’re observing more and more. These firms raise funding, as would a startup or venture firm, then they use that money to vacuum up a bunch of patents for the sole purpose of suing other companies. That’s bad for the economy, bad for innovation, and frankly, a loophole — a kink — that needs to be resolved. TC: It looks like Anthony Petruccelli was a state senator for nine years. I guess you don’t have term limits in Massachusetts? Do you see yourself staying put for a while? EL: Unlike in California [where you are], we have no term limits here. And yes, I’m [really dedicated to the issue]. The tech community hasn’t been engaged in public policy, and for a variety of reasons, you now see the entrepreneurship community and the VC community — especially at the state level — start to really step up and talk about why these protections are important. So we’re really focused on it. There’s inaction on the federal level and complete dysfunction in Congress. Patents and IP have traditionally been the province of the federal government. But for states like California and Massachusetts, this is too important a part of our economy and job creation to wait for the government to get involved. TC: Is there a state that you’ve used in creating your bill, one that you think is getting it right when it comes to patent trolls? EL: There are 33 states with some version of this legislation, so it’s not a brand new idea. It’s been tested in lots of places, with varying degrees of strictness. Given how important startups and venture capital are to Massachusetts, it’s a little embarrassing that we don’t have similar legislation CrunchbaseCloudflare is a web performance and security company

Rob LeFebvre, @roblef 8m ago in month, a Senate committee created a proposal to allow autonomous vehicles onto the roads under specific safety and \"tech neutral\" requirements. Now that the bill has hit House of Representatives, the bipartisan Energy and Commerce Committee voted to send it along to the full chamber. The Safely Ensuring Lives Future Deployment and Research In Vehicle Evolution Act, or SELF DRIVE, is aimed at allowing companies like Uber and Google to test up to 100,000 autonomous vehicles across the country. While we're far from an actual bill, this seems like good forward movement. If driverless cars are ever going to gain a foothold on the road, they'll need to be as safe as (or safer that) current automobiles are. Companies like Lyft, GM and Toyota have been lobbying for this type of legislation for a while now. The Department of Transportation will need to ensure this if it wants to exempt the vehicles from federal rules that govern current cars, like the requirement they have steering wheels, for example. The proposed bill, which isn't yet scheduled for full House consideration, also bars states from setting their own possibly conflicting regulations around the design, operation and software components of self-driving cars. States will be able to restrict autonomous vehicles on public roads in some way, according to ReCode.

Former Battlefield runner-up UnifyID announces $20M Series APosted 30 minutes ago by Ron Miller StoryBoxed is trying to predict when you’ll run out of snacks and toilet paperTechCrunch Disrupt alum UnifyID has the clear goal of changing the way we think about authentication. Instead of entering a username and password as the only line of defense to our computer systems, it wants us to rely on other data that comes from the phone in our pockets. That smartphone has a number of sensors in it like an accelerometer and a GPS, and using the kinds of data it gather from the phone, the company can begin to build an understanding of who you are, your typical behaviors and even the cadence of how you walk. It pulls this information into a machine learning back-end to process it and build a profile of each individual in the system. The username and password doesn’t go away completely with this technique, but it becomes a secondary form of authentication when the system lacks a high enough probability that it is a given person. You could understand how an approach like that would be attractive to any number of companies and governments, all of which are desperately looking for better ways to secure their systems. It was that same creative thinking that got the company into the TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield in San Francisco last year, where it placed second, and it is the same reasoning that attracts investors. Today, the company announced a $20 million Series A investment led by NEA with participation from Andreessen Horowitz, Stanford-StartX and Accomplice Ventures, each of which had participated in the company’s seed round. When it launched at the Battlefield competition last fall, the company announced a consumer-focused Chrome browser plug-in with an iOS app. Today, it has changed focus, offering a Software Development Kit (SDK) to customers to install their authentication tools as a service inside any application. “The business model is to sell the SDK and backend platform to companies with pre existing mobile apps and charge on a per-API call basis,” co-founder Kurt Somerville told TechCrunch. It’s similar to how a company would add payment services to an application using Stripe or communications services using Twilio. Once the UnifyID tools are in place, a user could simply walk up to their computer, and without signing in, start working because the system would understand based on the UnifyID information that it was that person. In turn, when the person walked away from the machine, it would deactivate it so that nobody else could use the computer. Somerville says the company has done accuracy tests to ensure the validity of the system and claims they have found it to be accurate 99. 99 percent of the time. Today, the company is working with 10 business partners on the SDK, and has 15 full time employees, but with $20 million in new money, they are shooting to have around 40 engineers in next 6-9 months. 8 Billion | Crunch ReportWatch More EpisodesStartup Posts Featured Stories Sling Studio Makes Multi-Camera Video Production So Damn Easy. com VIPFonts by NetworkUnicorn LeaderboardGift GuidesAll GalleriesAll Timelines ReportDisrupt NY 2017Judah vs the MachinesAll ShowsAll Videos EventsDisruptStartup AfricaBattlefield City StoreAll Events CrunchbaseMessage UsMost PopularOffshore U.

Wherever it is, it’s the home of Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) and his family. As Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) and his Death Troopers march towards Erso and his homestead, Galen tells his daughter Jyn, “Whatever I do, I do it to protect you. Say you understand,” he intones, as we get a good look at the young Jyn. This is the first time footage has been widely released of her, but she was included in the trailer shown to attendees at Star Wars Celebration earlier this year.

We know from details released about the upcoming prequel novel Catalyst that these two have a long history together. Also, it looks like Krennic’s swanky-as-hell uniform comes with a waterproof variant. Stylish and practical! As Krennic sets his eyes on the young Jyn hiding in the grass, we smash-cut to the present—with Jyn (now played by Felicity Jones) in an Imperial detention facility. It’s cut to make it look like Jyn is waking up from dreaming about her past, but either way, this is definitely from early on in the film. GIF Jyn is busted out of captivity by some Rebels. The way this opening of the trailer is cut seems to heavily imply that they rescue Jyn on Jedha. moment. If so, we know she comes back with Cassian later. Speaking of which, here’s a gorgeous shot of a U-Wing flying over the planet’s surface—and it’s definitely Jedha, because of the crumbled statue of a Jedi Knight the ship flies over.

GIF Jyn bristles, but that’s when Mothma drops a bombshell—the Rebels know Galen is working on the Death Star’s superlaser. We cut to a shot of an Imperial facility, where Krennic meets up with Galen again, this time flanked by Stormtroopers and in an Imperial uniform. We skip a little ahead with Jyn’s team formed. They depart from Yavin, with Imperial defector Bodhi Rook (Riz Ahmed) giving the team its callsign: Rogue One. See, was it so hard to say that, Gareth Edwards?

Seriously, all these trailers have basically been Death Star porn. The Rebels, however, are less impressed and more petrified. “If the Empire has this kind of power,” a sympathizer intones over a hologram of the Death Star, “what chance do we have? ”GIF As if to make her point, we cut to Jedha, where a big fight has broken out—and the Empire are just slaughtering people left, right, and center. Presumably this is not during Jyn’s breakout, as she’s with Cassian this time around. GIF A short shot of Clone Wars veteran Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker)a nd his robot leg is played under Jyn’s simple retort. “We have hope. Rebellions are built on hope! ” It’s a little cheesy, but suitably inspiring.

We see a fancy shot of the Imperial facility, as well as Rebel troopers sneaking up on it through the foliage. We also finally learn why Jyn was wearing an Imperial uniform in the very first trailer: She’s disguised as a member of the ground crew alongside Cassian as an officer and K2-SO (Alan Tudyk) as. well, himself. He is a re-programmed Imperial droid, after all. It looks like they’re infiltrating the base on Scarif.

That hope he and Jyn keeping referencing can make “10 men feel like a hundred,” according to Cassian. GIF We get a few more shots of X-Wings and Y-Wings battling in a dark canyon, an extended look at a scene from the last trailer. It’s hard to tell if this is simply Jedha at night or a different planet. We know there’s at least one other big location, a planet called Eadu (thanks to Jyn’s action figure designating her appearance as being on that planet).

GIF Meanwhile, it looks like we’re getting at least a little bit of a space battle in Rogue One. X-Wings launch an attack on a facility (which looks like it’s in orbit above Scarif, considering the amount of water on the planet below). It’s not the Death Star, but some kind of other Imperial station. Jyn calls out the Alliance operatives on Yavin. “You’re all rebels, aren’t you? ” This is the most optimism we’ve seen from Rogue One, which previously was very doom and gloom about our heroes’ chances. GIF A massive explosion tears apart the surface of Jedha while a figure looks on—the goggles and hair make it look like it’s Bohdi. This looks like part of a sequence we saw in the last trailer of Cassian and Jyn’s U-Wing fleeing a huge blast.

Richard Lawler, @Rjcc 1h ago in SecurityComments Lloyd D. George Federal Courthouse Getty ImagesJust a couple of days after the FBI arrested Marcus Hutchins (aka MalwareTech) he made an appearance in a Las Vegas federal courthouse, pleading not guilty to charges accusing him of creating the Kronos banking malware. KSNV News 3 Las Vegas reporter Christy Wilcox reported from the scene, tweeting that prosecutors claim Hutchins admitted to writing malware code (presumably for the Kronos banking malware) as well as playing a role in its sale and distribution. An update on @MalwareTechBlog and some clarification on misreported facts. Andrew Mabbitt (@MabbsSec) August 5, 2017Fidus Information Security co-founder Andrew Mabbitt has spoken out in his defense and tried to clear up some apparent misinformation about the 23-year-old hacker's stay in Las Vegas during Def Con. While some reports have focused on the pricey Airbnb mansion where Hutchins stayed and the rented supercars he was driving, Mabbitt says that the stay in the villa was free, and someone else paid to rent the Corvette and Lamborghini he tweeted about. The prosecutors apparently also cited tweets from the past week where Hutchins fired guns (legally) at a local range as a reason why he should not be granted bail. His lawyer Adrian Lobo called that claim \"garbage\" while telling reporters outside the courthouse that the judge determined he is not a flight risk said he would be released once certain conditions are met. Those include raising $30,000 for bail, and reportedly he will be banned from internet access or contact with his unnamed co-defendant. Unfortunately, because the clerk's office closed at 4 PM that has not happened yet. The attorney expects he will be released on Monday, but he will need to appear in Wisconsin to face the grand jury indictment there. Marcus Hutchins has been regarded worldwide as a hero due to his actions during the recent WannaCry outbreak, and Andrew Mabbitt says that as soon as tomorrow there will be a crowdfunding campaign starting to help raise funds for his legal defense.

agoFiled to: facebook nightsinternet to KinjaToggle Conversation toolsGo to permalinkScreenshot via FacebookFather Frank Pavone, who calls himself “one of the most prominent pro-life leaders in the world,” streamed some questionable content on Facebook Live on Sunday in the name of Donald Trump or priest, once granted the “Proudly Pro-life Award” from the National Right to Life Committee, streamed a sermon in anticipation of the election standing before (in his own words) “a child who was killed by abortion and entrusted to us by a pathologist for burial. ”“Today I am doing something rather extraordinary,” Pavone says, gazing into the camera to commence the 44-minute live stream. Advertisement“We are going to pray with this baby and we are going to let this baby’s body bear witness to our nation as we begin the process to elect our next president,” the priest continues, inanely listing off various levels of government. Ravone calmly presents the viewer with “a very simple choice. ” To either “elect those who are going to affirm the covenant we have with God or those who reject it. ” Donald Trump is perhaps closer to God than his opponent considering he presumably grabbed his covenant right by the pussy. “The testimony of scripture and the testimony of the life of this child point to the critical importance of this election,” the priest explains. He urges viewers—of which there were over 250,000—to choose life. In the description of the video, he asserts that voting for Donald Trump and Republicans in general means you’re voting to protect a Facebook Live stream of a priest with a dead baby convince people to vote for Trump? Hard to say. Is Frank’s dead fetus real? Is it even allowed on Facebook? Should it be? In September, the company took down a Pulitzer-winning photograph of a naked Vietnamese girl covered in Napalm. Facebook then reversed its initial decision and reinstated the photo, giving the following statement:After hearing from our community, we looked again at how our Community Standards were applied in this case. An image of a naked child would normally be presumed to violate our Community Standards, and in some countries might even qualify as child pornography. In this case, we recognize the history and global importance of this image in documenting a particular moment in time. We have reached out to Facebook to ask if Pavone’s content is allowed on the platform and will update the post if we get a Facebook’s community standards, the company removes “graphic images when they are shared for sadistic pleasure or to celebrate or glorify violence. ” So I guess it depends if the priest live streamed this dead fetus for “sadistic pleasure. ” One could make a pretty compelling case for that.

RootgizmodoEven the Cast Has Trouble Explaining Legion in a New VideoKatharine TrendacostaToday 4:45pmFiled to: to KinjaToggle Conversation toolsGo to permalinkGIF Image: Legion, FXLegion is a TV show that is so out there and complicated that its cast isn’t quite sure how to describe it. Thankfully, executive producer Noah Hawley seems to know what’s going on, even if no one else new first look video at Legion gives us the most comprehensive look yet at this new series, and it looks amazing, weird, and eclectic. In the video, after the cast makes jokes about how they don’t know anything, Hawley also gives the best description of the series we’ve seen yet, saying, “This is a show about a man named David Haller, who has been diagnosed as a schizophrenic and has spent the last five years in a psychiatric institution. He begins to get the sense that he may not be crazy, that he may have these abilities. ”There’s a lot of footage in this video, with a lot of unusual angles and color. The show promises a lot of questions about what is real and what is only in David’s head. Given how orange the dance sequence is, I wonder if color is going to help us sort out the real from the fake in this series. There’s also a bit of a scene that we’ve previously glimpsed in the trailers. It shows David using his powers in what looks like an escape attempt from a bunker. GIF This feels pretty squarely in the X-Men realm and, if I were a betting person, looks like David leading a bunch of mutants away from somewhere. It’s not the glass house overlooking things that we seen Jean Smart’s character, Melanie Bird, lecture David in. But it does look like a similar said, this is just speculation since “David Haller is a mutant and has trouble with reality” is pretty much all we officially know about this show. Legion premieres on FX on February 8.

Upgrade Your TV To a 55\" 4K Samsung For Just $500Jillian Lucas16 minutes agoFiled to: Kinja to KinjaGo to permalinkSamsung 55\" 4K TV, $500The most popular TV we posted last year was the Samsung UN55KU6300, which includes a 4K panel, smart apps, and even HDR. We saw it get as low as $550, but the nearly identical UN55KU6290 is now on sale for just only difference, so far as I can tell, is the UN55KU6290 doesn’t have a Smart Remote. If you can live without that, you’d be hard pressed to find a better picture for this price.

from afar in disbelief. Autoblog 56m ago in are the first to make pure bred F1 technology roadworthy. \" AMG has finally shown the mechanical layout of its thousand-horsepower, Formula 1-inspired Project One hypercar at a sneak reveal at the Nürburgring 24 Hour race. AMG Chairman Tobias Moers insists the car will become the new hypercar benchmark, with an F1-based 1. 6-liter, electrified, turbocharged V6 and four electric motors. The all-wheel drive hypercar won't just deliver levels of performance unparalleled outside the world's racetracks, but will be able to run as a pure battery-electric car for up to 15 miles and, unique for a hypercar, its zero-emission mode will be front-wheel drive. That should make it capable of circumventing limitations on internal-combustion, high-powered cars in some city centers around the world. \"It shifts up the boundaries of what is technically feasible,\" AMG Chairman Tobias Moers said, with production limited to just 275 models. \"We are the first to make pure bred F1 technology roadworthy. \"\"Our objective is not speed, but to be the benchmark. If we have a strategy and we move into a new era of performance at AMG, maybe it's good to have something that opens the door in a very authentic way to that new era and this is it. \"Plug-in hybrid is going to be the future for AMG. We get more performance and more efficiency and what's wrong with that? \" he asked. Technically, though, Ferrari used a Formula One engine as the basis of its F50 supercar back in 1995, though Moers insists the Project One would be a class forward from the least loved of the hypercar Ferraris. \"We are talking about a high-performance hybrid, with one combustion engine and four electric motors. The combustion engine comes from Brixworth, from the same people who delivered three consecutive Formula One World Championships for drivers and manufacturers. \"The redline is at 11,000 and it has a high-tech turbo, which is driven by a 107-horsepower electric motor. Its batteries are the same technology and arrangement as in F1, but we will build four times the storage, with about 25km of pure electric range. \"We have reached thermal efficiency of 43 percent. Nobody else has managed anything like that, street legal. \"By comparison, AMG's 4. 0-litre biturbo V8 has a thermal efficiency of around 25 percent. At $2. 54 million, the two-seat, hard-top coupe follows Formula One practice by basing the entire car around a carbon-fibre chassis tub, then mounting the engine directly to the tub and mounting the gearbox and differential unit directly to the engine. Both the engine and eight-speed gearbox will be fully stressed parts of the chassis layout, while AMG has chosen to use a computer controlled clutch on a traditional manual gearbox, rather than the dual-clutch transmission layout most supercar makers, including Bugatti, favor. The first deliveries of the car are due late next year, with Moers hoping to finish its production run by the end of 2020, and AMG already has one \"mule\" prototype running to help with initial verification of the powertrain and chassis concept. But the key part of the technology is the Project One's powertrain itself, which AMG insists it pulled directly from its Formula 1 program. Though heavily revised from the W08 EQ Power+ F1 car used by Lewis Hamilton and Valteri Bottas this weekend in Monaco, AMG Chairman Tobias Moers insists the modifications are only basic. \"The idle speed is 1,100 rpm and in F1 it's 3,800 or 4,000. It revs to 11,000 rpm, but in F1 it's 13,500 rpm. \"We have to move combustion ratio, for example, that's what changes. In F1 they run Lambda that's way more than one. But we can't because of emissions. We have the same cylinder head, same crank housing but a different crankshaft. \"For all that, though, Moers insists customers won't need the usual array of Formula One race engineers and laptop computers to start the engine. \"Prospective buyers have been asking if they will require a support crew or dedicated lubricants to run it. My answer is always 'no. ' It will be a street car. You keep it plugged in in the garage. You fill it with 98 (Ron fuel). \"The trickier parts of the powertrain will be the way it combines its electrified and internal-combustion power. A ground-breaking engine in Formula One, the AMG V6 splits its single, large turbocharger, with the exhaust turbine moved to the back of the engine with the exhaust system and the compressor wheel sitting at the front of the engine where the cooler air is. A shaft runs through the engine's vee angle to join them together. Firstly, there is the power and torque from the tiny 1. 6-liter V6 (which AMG wouldn't talk about, but which must be somewhere around 470 hp). Then it also has a 134-hp electric motor (the MGU-K for \"kinetic\" in AMG-speak) directly attached to the engine's crankshaft and another 107-hp (the MGU-H for \"heat\") electric motor that spins up the turbocharger to eliminate turbo lag. \"The 80kW from the MGU-H is not so important to rev it (the turbocharger compressor) up but it's important for regeneration,\" Moers insisted. \"It could be a lot smaller to rev and still spin it up. \"Any excess energy the MGU-H harvests can be sent directly to the MGU-K to punch more electric torque directly through the crankshaft. Then there a 161-horsepower electric motor for each front wheel, which use essentially the same construction and design as the MGU-K, but in different housings. While Moers would not be drawn on the car's target weight, he did confirm that the entire powertrain would weight about 926 pounds, with the battery pack accounting for 220 lbs of that. The battery, built by its F1 supplier ABC, runs the same chemistry, cells and connectors as Hamilton's racer, but is four times larger to add in the Project One's zero-emission capability. What makes the Project One particularly complicated is that all of its electric motors act as both motors and generators to recharge the fast-discharge battery, which has a converter to turn 800 volts into 12 volts sitting on top of its housing. The extreme forces acting inside the highly stressed 1. 6-liter V6 mean AMG will only rate it for 31,000 miles before it needs to be \"remanufactured\". \"We have an understanding of about 50,000 km. This is OK for us. I think that's good enough,\" Mr. Moers insisted. \"That's the life of the engine. Then we do some rework, like in a race car. \"After 31,000 miles, the engines would either be rebuilt by AMG or, depending on the work needed, replaced, and AMG didn't rule out customers choosing to buy the car with a spare engine ready to go. As an aside, it has yet to put a price tag on either a new engine or a rebuild. This year's Formula One rules dictate that each driver can only use four hybrid power units for the entire 20-race season, though that drops to three of the V6 internal-combustion engines next year. While that's just over 3,728 miles of Grand Prix racing, the engines and electrified power units could easily double that with four hours of practice and a one-hour qualifying shootout each race weekend. The supercar industry's widespread reaction to Moers' claims of using a Formula One motor has been disbelief. Ferrari basically said it doesn't believe Mercedes-AMG. Ferrari, the only other race-winning Formula One engine supplier this year, clearly doubts whether AMG's hypercar was a) using an F1-sourced engine and b) whether that was a good idea in the first place. In an interview back at the Geneva Motor Show, Ferrari's road-car chief engineer, Michael Leiters, said there was no way Ferrari would follow suit. \"Putting an F1 engine into a road car? We already did it with the F50 and I'm not convinced it works. An F1 engine runs at 16,000 rpm. How can you use a car that revs to 16,000 rpm on the street? You can't, and if it doesn't rev to 16,000 rpm, you have to ask the question, what remains of the Formula 1 engine? \"Instead of actual F1 engine, I'm convinced it's better to take some concepts and innovations from a Formula 1 car. To make a supercar, I prefer to do it from scratch,\" he insisted. The all-wheel-drive Project One hypercar has fine torque vectoring at both ends, and eliminates the packaging difficulties of anti-roll bars via five-link suspension systems at both ends. AMG has separated the vertical bump and roll tasks in the suspension with two springs in series sharing a single damper, while the longest rear pushrod in the car world is mounted directly to the upright and in large part defines the car's aerodynamic package. It will use a variable ride height and a variable aerodynamic package, to get the best from its custom-developed Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 285/35 19 front and 335/30 20 tires, which ride on center-lock wheels. The transmission, too, will be similar to the Formula One car's eight-speed unit, strengthened for longevity, and using the electric motors to \"fill in\" any acceleration holes during gear changes. Moers insists the car will have different driving modes, ranging from the zero-emission front-drive BEV mode to a mode so aggressive it will be similar to a Grand Prix qualifying setup.

to permalinkWhen you do something every day, even if you enjoy it, it becomes routine. Like your morning coffee. If you have a habit you used to love that’s become boring, give it up for a few days. AdvertisementAs advice site Barking Up the Wrong Tree explains, even the things we love most can become dull if they fall into habit. Maybe you started drinking coffee because you liked the taste, but now it’s just a thing you have to drink to get through the day. You don’t even enjoy it anymore. If you’ve reached that point, skip it for a few days to hit the reset button on your appreciation for it. What’s something you used to relish that you now take for granted? Did that first morning cup of coffee used to be a wonderful moment — and now it’s just something you hastily gulp down? Well, skip it for three days. And then, once the three days are over, oh man, SAVOR that coffee — or whatever it is that you’ve denied yourself. This can work for just about any indulgence that’s become habit. If you’ve grown bored of listening to music, your morning bagel, or even if you’re falling into a routine in your relationship, taking a step back from your habit can give you time to remember what your life is like without it. Take a few days without turning on the TV or playing that video game and see just how much you miss it by the Reveals 4 Rituals That Will Make You Happy | Barking Up the Wrong TreePhoto by Vesselin Dochkov.

More posts by this contributor:UPDATED: Attack of the dronesThe Age of Resilience – Security in 2017As Content Delivery Networks (CDN) market leaders like Akamai and CloudFlare grapple with technological shifts, some innovators like Teridion, Signal Sciences and Section. io (in which I am an investor) are making rapid advances. The CDN market, estimated at $5bn today, is anticipated to be over $10bn by 2019. While the market is growing rapidly, can the giants learn to dance? How are the startup aiming slingshots at the legacy Goliaths? Newcomers like Stackpath aim to win by offering a “security first” CDN, which in the wake of the #CloudBleed can be a marketing differentiator. Above all, how will that elephant in the room – Amazon Cloudfront – trample all the unicorns? Looking back: A brief history of CDNsThe first wave of CDNs started with Akamai almost two decades ago in 1998. CDNs were designed to accelerate web content. In the world of constrained bandwidth, speed of delivery is affected by a variety of factors including page content and effective routing of traffic. Web companies that experience heavy web traffic needed a reliable, rapid mechanism to ensure uninterrupted service. Akamai promised all that, and then some. Within a year of its launch, Akamai went IPO and had Apple Computer as its logo customer. At the time, Apple constituted 45% of its total $1. 2m revenues. Limelight Networks was a fast-follower to Akamai and was launched in 2001. It went public in 2007 but has not been able to catch up with Akamai. In 2016, Akamai posted $2. 3bn in revenues with a market cap of over $10 billion. (Limelight Networks posted $170 million revenues in 2016 with a market cap of $290 million. Private Equity shops, take note. )Over time, websites became more dynamic and bloated, and we entered the SaaS /application era. And then, the shifts of cloud and mobility changed the way content was delivered and consumed. CDNs started to mitigate DDOS attacks. Add the growing demand for security to that mix and slowly but surely, the CDN universe is getting disrupted. Amazon launched its own CDN – Cloudfront in 2008. Cloudflare started circa 2009 offering content delivery, security and analytics. In 2011, Fastly got launched and recently announced a new $50m funding round. Stackpath raised $180m in a single round to disrupt CDN markets. It’s CEO, Lance Crosby is a badass who started SoftLayer sold it to IBM for $2 bn. Having that kind of an exit made it easier for Lance to raise a war chest of $180m. CompanyYear StartedCapital 2009$182 mNEA, Union Square Ventures, FidelityFastlyMarch 2011$179 mBattery Ventures, August Capital, Iconiq, Sapphire PartnersThese newcomers have created headaches for Akamai, eating into its margins steadily forcing the price down. Akamai’s Media Delivery Solutions revenue for 2016 was down 9% year-over-year. As CDNs supply-demand curve shifts, customers are enjoying price drops of 20% to 40%. Grappling with changesAs we enter the new applications / devops driven world, the developers will drive the nextgen CDN consumption. Dynamic microservices, Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) and of course, performance and security remains paramount. Let us look at some of the technological shifts:Bloated web pages: We are fat, getting fatter: Average bytes per web page has grown ~3X to 2. 4 MB in the past five years, as reported by Akamai study shows, web page load times for desktops have increased by 63. 8% in two years, from 7. 2 seconds (2013) to 11. 8 seconds (2015). And when it comes to dynamic content, customized to enhance the user experience, all bets are off. Steven Sinofsky, the former President of Windows division of Microsoft tweeted recently about LinkedIn slow load time as his ‘favorite new feature’. The growth of video: As the CDNs attempt to deliver bloated pages, the type of content has shifted. The demand for video / live streaming / dynamic application content continues to grow. Video is expected to grow 4X by 2020 when Cisco predicts 82% of all IP traffic will be video. Video consumption during busy-hour Internet traffic (7pm-11pm) is expected to grow nearly 5-fold from 2015 to 2020. Dynamic content and bandwidth peaks is the new CDN game, away from static cached content. Mobile consumption increases: By 2020, ~30% of traffic is expected to come from smartphones. The average load time for mobile sites is much more worse – 19 seconds over 3G connections. In a September 2016 “The Need for Mobile Speed” study, Google found that 53% of mobile site visits are abandoned if pages take longer than 3 seconds to load. The data, based on analysis of more than 10,000 mobile Web domains suggested that mobile sites load in 5 seconds earn up to 2 times more mobile ad revenue than those whose sites load in 19 seconds. So publishers are motivated to drive for speed. And we all know that one second delay in Amazon’s web page load time could burn $1. 6bn in sales. Accelerating content for mobile is a headache for CDNs. Not too far away in the future are gaming, VR/AR and IoT companies. The times they are a changing – and getting messier. Such technological changes are forcing CDNs to improve speed, while dealing with dynamic content. Optimizing traffic routes over diverse network pathways (ISP, 3G, mobile), balancing load / peak demand and ensuring security is now expected of CDNs. While legacy CDNs are slow to react, several upstarts are tackling traffic optimization, nextgen WAF and DevOps friendly CDNs. Optimization of routing:The routing of internet traffic is determined by an archaic Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which does not factor in timing for data routing. It only looks at the number of hops between two networks. But what if the route with least number of hops may be congested? Or the protocol picks a physically longer route? For example, a packet may traverse from San Francisco to Los Angeles via Brazil. What if there was a route with multiple hops but was much more faster? BGP works really well in terms of reliability. It is a fundamental technology on which the Internet is built, but BGP is sub-optimal from a latency (delays, jitter, and image freezing) standpoint. Teridion acts like the ‘waze of internet traffic’ and optimizes traffic routes using third party cloud. Its platform helps make real time packet routing decisions to avoid congested paths. Unlike CDNs, its solution scales on-demand and is not limited by upstream communication, pre-provisioned PoPs, geography or cloud providers. It is therefore much quicker to provision. As there is no caching of data, SSL certificate management, security and compliance issues are non-existent. It extends to each and every end-user of a cloud-delivered service. Chris Keene, chief executive of Teridion says, “As you add more options for acceleration, each has its own security implications and possible tradeoffs. Some companies do not want to share SSL Certificates and give up the keys to their kingdom. CDNs cannot do much for such companies. ”Egnyte, an Enterprise File Sync and Sharing (EFSS) upstart beat some of the giants of file share companies such as Box, Citrix, Google and Microsoft. It was faster by 30% in speed over Box and as much as 60% for larger 4GB files. Egnyte was ranked one of the top vendors achieving high marks in a IDC study of sync performance of file share and storage vendors. Kris Lahiri. Cofounder of Egnyte says, “The IDC speed test looked at the time to “synchronize” content between the local client and the cloud. This is bidirectional, so any changes made on endpoints needed to be synchronized ASAP. We used a robust web socket connection, smart clients and Teridion’s network acceleration. All these different optimizations got reflected in the results observed by IDC. ”Instead of the conventional CDN path, Egnyte created its own PoPs and partnered with Teridion to optimize the route dynamically in a continuously optimized fashion. In such a scenario, no SSL off-loading was required and that reduced the potential attack surface. ​Peter Christy of 451 Research pointed out that Teridion is clever non-obvious technology and for any CDN, it would take time and effort to replicate it. “Even then, it will likely be inferior initially. And then time and effort will be required to operate, maintain and improve such an offering. ” While optimized routing is one of the CDN areas of innovation, security is another hot area. Content + security = Better CDNCDNs moved into security by offering DDoS protection. A site could be taken down with a flood of requests. With a CDN fronting the traffic, the netflow traffic patterns can be analyzed and scrubbed inline. In recent times, CDNs have started to push into offering Web Application Firewalls (WAF) and Bot mitigation. Enterprise customers now look to CDNs to manage web security. Akamai’s Cloud Security Solutions 2016 revenue was up 43% year-over-year. While CDNs aim for improved security, CDNs themselves can be vulnerable. In his blog post, David Hobbs writes about several CDN security challenges which include dynamic content attacks, SSL based attacks and direct IP attacks. The recent Cloudbleed incident shows that infrastructure complexity has its tradeoffs. Peter Christy of 451 Research says, “Cloudbleed was frightening because it leaked private information for some Cloudflare customers. I’m sure most people didn’t think even possible. Cloudbleed and the recent AWS S3 problems were both good ole “bugs” — longstanding interactions between complex systems that often go unnoticed. ” Cloudbleed and Heartbleed (a 2014 bug) were examples where customer data that should have been shielded got leaked. In another study, sixteen CDNs failed in a simulated forwarding loop attack. Here, a malicious customer of any CDN can create forwarding loops inside CDNs. Forwarding loops can cause CDNs to process one client request repetitively effectively launching a DoS attacks against CDNs. So far, DDoS attacks against web sites was well know but this was the first time when a DoS attack can be launched against a CDN itself by one of its customers. Its often easy to sign up for a CDN and get a free account. Launching a forward loop attack is not too difficult. Andrew Petersen, CEO of Signal Sciences is building the next generation Web Access Firewall (WAF) that combines security with usability for the DevOps world. Having faced these challenges in his previous life at Etsy, Andrew and his team have taken a bottoms up approach. “CDNs can’t get deployed on internal apps. As multiple security tools have to be used it gets harder to manage quickly. If we take a step back, CDNs primary focus is speed. Philosophically and technically, this creates tradeoffs with performance” Petersen says. In his blog post, Zane Lackey, co-founder of Signal Sciences identified six appsec challenges that CDNs may struggle to solve. The development environment is unlikely to have the same configuration as production due to cost and architecture restrictions. As these environments don’t match, a CDN-based WAF will often trigger false positives in production that are completely unreproducible in development. Debugging failures at this level is frustrating, because access to the CDN console is restricted to the operations team. In practice, a CDN-based WAF is not very friendly to those pursuing DevOps. From Centralized to Dispersed: The Cloud becomes the EdgeErnie Regalado, Editor-in-Chief of Bizety, a market research publication says “Edge security as a business model has taken off and it is fastest growing segment in the industry. Companies like CloudFlare, Incapsula and Distil Networks are pushing to offer DDoS Mitigation, WAF and Bot Mitigation. ” Window Snyder, Chief Security Officer at Fastly echoes the sentiment, “We see data / traffic patterns, understand vulnerabilities and can enhance edge security to further protect our customers in specific ways. ” In this classic innovator’s dilemma, the newcomers are able to start with a clean slate, while incumbents work from their position of strength. Fastly recently announced a $50m funding round claiming a $100m annual run rate. Yet Fastly could become slowly if another “edge CDN” Stackpath continues down its war path. With 45 PoPs in 25 Cities, Stackpath has grown rapidly via five acquisitions including MaxCDN and Highwinds, offering integrated acceleration and security The Modern Day CDN should do a lot more. (Image Courtesy: Stackpath)James Leaverton, VP Ecosystem Development, Stackpath says “Legacy CDNs are not ready for the shifts to online video and IoT. They have Frankenstein platforms—a user might have to log into a dozen different portals. They have aging infrastructures that were optimized for CDN, but not built to adapt or scale. That’s why companies like ours exist. The StackPath platform is an integrated response to a fragmented problem created by too many delivery and security solutions. ”The DevOps friendly CDNAs developers become the prime focus for some startups, a DevOps friendly CDN based in Colorado, Section. io is slowly but surely establishing its roots. (Disclosure: I am an investor in Section. io via Secure Octane seed fund). Backed by Techstars Ventures, Section. io CEO Stewart McGrath wanted to build a platform for developers. Dev teams need new control tools and flexibility in staging and testing their content. “They really have no idea how the site will run until they get into production. And then you need the visibility / metrics once you are in production “ says Stewart. To manage traffic, CDNs use different types of reverse proxies such as squid cache, Nginx or Varnish Cache. In a containerized environment, you could have multiple reverse proxies to choose from. In his blog post titled CDN’s are dying, Stewart argues that engineers should not feel locked into any one proxy software stack at any one time. Rather, they should be able to pick and choose the tools that work best for their website. The multi-tenancy also allows isolation, reducing risk of contamination. Section. io aims to decouple proxy software from the networks and takes a software-driven approach to configuration, management and deployment of reverse proxies. “We believe this is the future of a web application delivery platform. Developers can have full control over reverse proxy configuration and experiment in a testing environment” says Stewart. The ease of installation, testing, performance and troubleshooting changes how developers can manage their processes from end to end. For legacy CDNs, this will be a challenge in the long run. As technology needs evolve, innovators are often able offer better solutions and expand certain markets. Ernie Regalado of Bizety writes that the CDN market is likely to be much larger, especially as hungry CDNs invade other tech sectors seeking new revenue streams. He expects the overall market to grow to $12bn by 2019. This is driven by a convergence (or a collision) between several markets such as CDNs, Multiprotocol label switching (MPLS), Software Defined Wide Area Networks (SD-WAN) market and the Cloud Radio Access Network (RAN) market. Companies like Cato Networks, Aryaka and Versa Networks have raised significant rounds of capital and are making strides in these segments. Betting on the winnersOn one end, web companies like Facebook, Netflix, Pandora and even Apple have shifted to managing their own content delivery. Legacy CDNs, left with no choice but to evolve. Should the giant Akamai worry about the cold Cloudfront blowing in from Seattle? According to Datanyze research on CDN markets, AWS Cloudfront is eating its way up from the bottom of the market and leads in the Alexa Top 1 million domains while Akamai is strong in the Top 100 domains. # of Akamai Domains# of AWS Cloudfront DomainsAlexa Top 100208Alexa Top 100018279Alexa Top 100,00030046275Alexa Top 1 Amazon has steadily crept up and added AWS WAF in 2015 and AWS Shield (DDoS mitigation) in 2016. How will this battle play out remains to be seen. Ernie Regalado says “AWS is the dominant provider of centralized cloud compute services. Akamai is the leader in edge services, including delivery, security and streaming. As processing, data and business logic move to the edge, Akamai has the advantage and can even disrupt AWS. ”Cloudflare, Stackpath and Fastly have raised enough capital. Who gets acquired or goes public remains to be seen. My hunch is Lance will aim for an IPO for Stackpath – it’s unlikely he will be content with anything less, especially knowing his last exit was a $2bn outcome. That could create some heartburn for Cloudflare and Fastly. The young Turks like Distil Networks, Section. io, Teridion, and Signal Sciences could raise mucho dinero, and become standalone companies. Telecom carriers and service providers will likely make some moves as networks converge with ‘software driven everything’. Those in the enviable nimbler / innovators category will win, no matter which way the wind blows.

Make Everyone Jealous With This OLED 4K TVShep McAllisterYesterday 12:03pmFiled to: Kinja to KinjaGo to permalinkLG 55\" OLED 4K TV, $1500If you love inky blacks and vibrant colors, and who doesn’t, this OLED LG TV is back down to $1500 today, with no sales tax for most buyers.

Bryan Singer talks about the new X-Men TV show’s connection to the wider mutant universe. James Mangold reveals why Professor X has hair in Logan. Plus, new details of a major Black Panther action scene, and a classic Doctor Who monster returns once more. Behold, to The Playlist, writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick are surprisingly and refreshingly optimistic about Ryan Reynold’s aims to get Hugh Jackman to star in a Deadpool/Wolverine crossover film. Here’s We’ve come a long way from 2009, when we couldn’t get the movie off the ground ’til now. And to have [this team-up]? It would be amazing to have Hugh resurrect Wolverine in the Deadpool universe, and again, Ryan’s making a hard push to make that happen, and hopefully the public gets behind it and we can all convince Hugh to put the claws on one more time. But if one did go through, according to Reese, it’d require a pretty big shuffling of the plans the pair currently have for the Deadpool movie Yeah, [a crossover] would, if you think about it. If you’re looking at Deadpool 2, if you’re looking at X-Force, if you’re looking at Deadpool 3, there’s not necessarily room for [another] team-up movie. I think it does create real scheduling and universe issues and something that could be ironed out, but it would need to be ironed out. I don’t think any of us operated under the assumption that it would be even possible to do a Deadpool/Wolverine thing, so we just haven’t planned for it, it’s still not in the plan, but if it were to happen, it would require a hard look at the overall architecture of our James Mangold explains why Patrick Stewart’s elderly Charles Xavier has some hair in the movie:[It] could be kind of sacrilege. The theory was that he originally lost all his hair because it’s just too damn busy [in his head] to grow hair – the idea for me was, well, maybe there’s a little fringe on there, because things are slowing down mentally. [Empire]Black PantherAccording to Variety, production is headed to South Korea to film a huge chase scene between Black Panther and the film’s primary villain, featuring 150 cars, 700 people, and even a few helicopters to boot. Oh, and loads of gunfire, obviously. Thor: RagnarokDirector Taika Waititi compares the scale of the movie to something like Civil Sometimes I would stop and think, I’m doing a movie that’s got Thor and Doctor Strange and The Incredible Hulk and Loki and every character is so strange and different. Civil War it’s just humans, humans with human problems. Ours is creatures and beings and all these sorts of really different characters. Again displaying human problems, but in outer space or in other worlds. He also confirms that he’s going to make a cameo appearance in the movie, but didn’t disclose the not like a thing that I’ve ever planned, but now I’m in all of my movies in a small role or a larger role. I’ll probably just keep doing that. It’s like a dumb thing I do now. [AV Club]SuspiriaFilming on the remake of the horror classic has now wrapped. [Deadline]Robin Hood: OriginsVisually, the film will be heavily inspired by John Wick, according to producer Basil images of Robin Hood, the imagery we have, the production design, the stunt work that we’re doing—a lot of it was inspired by the John Wick stunt work. The stuff we’re doing with the bow and arrow, it’s the same thing that Keanu does with the gun. The costumes, it just feels different than any other Robin Hood we had. Iwanyk goes on to describe the film’s gritty, PTSD-driven angle on the Robin Hood legend. Exempting the killer cast, I feel that it captures the adventure and the fun and the spirit of Robin Hood, but because it’s the origin story—it’s a kid going off to war thinking he’s going on a great Crusade, and realizing it’s all bullshit and coming back with some PTSD and realizing he’s been lied to, and coming back to kind of a fractured society that doesn’t really accept him and realizing, ‘Okay the super rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting poorer. ’ You could describe that now. What Joby Harold, our writer, was able to do is make it feel very allegorical and very contemporary, and feel youthful but not youthful in a YA way, youthful in a kind of, the anger, the energy, what people when they were 25 feel, without it being pandering like ‘Look, we’re the young version of the Skull IslandThe new Imax poster is very Kongpocalypse Now.

The X-Men TV ShowBryan Singer reconfirms Matt Nix’s recent tease that the series will feature some familiar mutant Some crossover is all I can really say. I can’t really speak to that. I come in and out of it, sort of, but I’ve been involved in it for about 20 years — I signed the deal in ’96! I think there’ll just be crossover and standalone. It’s just the right thing to do. The X-Men universe is every bit as big as the rest of the whole Marvel universe, so why not? [Mashable]Doctor WhoClassic Who monsters the Ice Warriors will re-return in season 10, according to writer (and Sherlock co-creator) Mark Gatiss. You can also expect “a new kind of Ice Warrior” according to the Gatiss, who also wrote the Ice Warriors’ earlier return in season eight’s “Cold Blood. ” That was a great episode, so we’re looking forward to this.

class action class action suit started seven years ago when Sony, NEX, Panasonic, and Hitachi were accused of colluding to inflate prices of optical drives. Now, if you purchased a computer during those dates, you’re eligible for some free money, but there is a catch. First off, only about half the U.

Right now, they’re collecting names and emails from people, but you don’t need to actually prove that you owned one of these drives in any way, so it’s unclear exactly when or how you’d get paid out.

As the LA venture market booms, Upfront closes its sixth fund with $400 millionPosted 1 hour ago by Jonathan Shieber StoryZillow and McMansion Hell bury the hatchet after nastygram rouses internet’s ireLos Angeles is the third largest market for venture capital investment in the United States with $4. 2 billion invested in the last year alone, and it’s perhaps the market where capital commitments are increasing at the fastest pace. With the public offering of Snap, and the billion dollar exits for both Dollar Shave Club and Qlogic, the city has also proven to be a place where investors are posting real returns. So it’s no wonder that one of Los Angeles’ oldest venture firms, Upfront Ventures, was able to close on $400 million for its sixth fund. The city is booming, and the blistering pace at which Upfront was able to close the fund (from launch to close within two-and-a-half months, according to managing partner, Mark Suster), is just another sign that the technology scene in Los Angeles is ascendant. Indeed, at the firm’s Upfront Summit, an invite only affair for investors, entrepreneurs, tastemakers and celebrities held earlier this year, Suster managed to wrangle celebrity entrepreneurs and investors like Kobe Bryant, Baron Davis, Tyra Banks, and Gwyneth Paltrow (and the mayor) to pitch the wonders of Los Angeles to the investment community. The $400 million oversubscribed fund is the largest ever raised in the city, Suster said, noting that the close brings the firms total assets under management to $2 billion. “LA has truly arrived,” Suster tells me. “In the past people were reluctant to see a really big VC in LA. Roughly 45% of the capital from the new fund will likely d be deployed in Los Angeles and Suthern California, Suster said. Indeed, a number of early stage and Series A-focused investment vehicles will likely feed into the already bulging ecosystem of strong startup companies. Suster declined to comment on the performance of the firm’s latest fund, but did say that its second fund was the best performing fund of its vintage, with investments in BillMeLater, Overture, and Investnet. Now with big bets on Ring, Loot Crate, GOAT, and TrueCar, there’s been a shift toward more consumer-focused offerings that can leverage what Tyra Banks has called Los Angeles'”silicon reach”. What limited partners were drawn to, in the funds ‘ latest closing was its track record. “What they saw was differentiation and performance,” said Suster. “A fund formed in Silicon Valley is competing for deal with every other manager. ”While the size of the fund has expanded Upfront has also expanded its team, meaning the focus of the firm’s investments will remain on seed and Series A round investors. “Almost 90% of the deals are sed capital and Series,” Suster said. Five years ago the firm had four partners, and now the firm employs six partners — including new addition Kobie Fuller, who came to Upfront from Accel in the past year. Now the firm’s investment partners include founder Yves Sisteron, Greg Bettinelli, Kara Nortman, Fuller, Suster, and Kevin Zhang. Stuart Lander is the firm’s partner in charge of operations and platform teams for the firm. Upfront Ventures managing partner Mark Suster and founder Yves SisteronFor Suster, Upfront’s success is a function of a broader trend toward the geographical dispersion of successful investment funds throughout the U. S. Pointing to Bijan Sabet’s Spark Capital in Boston, to Fred Wilson’s Union Square Ventures in New York, and Philadelphia’s First Round Capital helmed by Josh Kopelman, Suster noted that the diversification of venture is more than just a consequence of geography. In a city like Los Angeles, which graduates more engineers than any other American urban center, and which has a broad, diverse background, gender and racial diversity are just as important to a firm’s success as the capital it raises. Suster underscored the importance of this in his own blog post about the fund’s close, writing:Upfront has long held the view that with regards to equality we should DO more than SAY but the events of the last weeks have led us to want to verbalize more our deep-seated commitment to equality in funding founders across ethnicities, nationalities and genders. We believe this isn’t just a market statement — it is where we will drive huge and differentiated returns. Dating back to Upfront II in 2000 (the single best performing fund in the US for that vintage) 2 of our 3 best returns were driven by companies with female founders / CEOs. More recently reports have come out listing VC firms ranked by percentage of female founders where we’re usually listed in the top 5% nationally. In our most recent fund ~30% of the companies we’ve backed have had at least one of the primary founders as a woman. As the firm looks ahead to its own future, Suster and the firm he’s helped grow remain committed to the future of Los Angeles.

Thomas MageeRepresentative Tom Graves (R-GA) thinks that when anyone gets hacked -- individuals or companies -- they should be able to \"fight back\" and go \"hunt for hackers outside of their own networks. \" The Active Cyber Defense Certainty (\"ACDC\") Act is getting closer to being put before lawmakers, and the Congressman trying to make \"hacking back\" easy-breezy-legal believes it would've stopped the WannaCry ransomware. Despite its endlessly lulzy acronym, Graves says he \"looks forward to formally introducing ACDC\" to the U. S. House of Representatives in the next few weeks. Hacking back sounds really awesome at first glance, and obviously, especially to lawmakers. The hacking back of \"ACDC\" in action would most likely happen just like on Mr. Robot, or in that movie about black hats. Evil hackers invade a company's computer system and plant a cyber-bomb. Except the company's IT department is actually a crack team of formerly-evil hackers who now work for the good guys (you can tell they're the good guys because they have jobs). Because it's now legal, the good guys dive into The Matrix and defuse the cyber-bomb just in time! Then they fly through the wires to get into the bad guy's computer, instantly downloading his name and address and Tinder profile, sending it instantly to the FBI who bust through the guy's door right as he's trying to wipe the files! Yeah, that's probably how lawmakers see it happening, too. Attacks that go both waysThe bipartisan ACDC bill would let companies who believe they are under ongoing attack break into the computer of whomever they think is attacking them, for the purposes of stopping the attack or gathering info for law enforcement. According to early press, the bill \"includes caveats such as you cannot destroy data on another person's computer, cause physical injury to someone or create a threat to public safety. This is Rep Graves's second attempt at making ACDC work out with all his friends. His May 25th revision of the legislation included attempts at limiting collateral damage, which as you may have suspected, is a particular criticism of people who work in infosec. According to Politico, who had the early scoop on the new version:Key changes include: a mandatory reporting requirement for entities that use active-defense technique to help federal law enforcement ensure such tools are used responsibly; a two-year sunset clause that would make Congress revisit the law in order to make changes; and an exemption allowing people or companies to recover their lost data if it's found using defensive techniques and can be grabbed back without destroying other data. Setting aside the naive idea that digital secrets can somehow be \"stolen back,\" just that information alone diagrams why hacking back generally isn't considered a great idea by most. Brian Bartholomew, senior security researcher at Kaspersky Lab, told Engadget, \"While the proposal's intent is to make it more difficult for an attack to be successful, it also raises major concern within the community. \" He explained that for starters, it's impossible to contain what data the victim touches when they're hacking back, destroying the bill's rule that victims only mess with their own stolen property. \"Another concern is for chain of custody preservation,\" Bartholomew told Engadget, even if victims tell law enforcement what they're about to do. \"Providing a 'plan of action' is a far cry from possessing the proper training or legal expertise on how to preserve evidence that will be upheld in a court of law,\" he explained. \"It is only a matter of time until the first criminal is prosecuted and evidence [is] thrown out due to improper chain of custody or is hard and usually wrong when not done by teams of professional analysts. And even then they get it wrong thanks to the incredible skills attackers have at what's called \"false flagging\" -- making attacks look like they're from someone else. Bartholomew, who co-authored the leading research on \"false flag operations\" agreed:\"As it has been demonstrated many times before, attackers are becoming more and more aware of techniques to throw defenders off their scent and lead them down a wrong path. \"\"Pointing the proverbial finger at another attacker is becoming more commonplace and with the introduction of this bill, the possible outcome of such an act can potentially be devastating. Performing proper attribution of an attack is an already difficult and sometimes impossible task, especially for an untrained person. \"There is also the serious concern that a hack back attack might spark a bigger issue between nations than anyone's considering. Last September, the Ethics + Emerging Sciences Group at Cal Poly released a report called \"Ethics of Hacking Back,\" a neutral look at the issues and laws surrounding the infosec version of \"an eye for an eye. \"The report comes from the stance that reasonable arguments exist to support hacking back. Still, in a summary from Patrick Lin, Ph. D. , the group's Director, Cal Poly found that the concept of hacking back fails across a number of categories. \"If meant as a deterrent,\" Lin wrote, \"hacking back would likely not deter malicious and ideological the paper cuts to the heart of all hacking back discussions by raising a critical issue: We don't know if it would actually work or not because there is no data. \"Currently,\" Lin said, \"there is no self-reporting of hacking back, because the practice is presumed to be 'likely illegal' according to the U. S. Department of Justice. \"We cannot track what we do not measure. Without that data—a way for individuals and organizations to safely report countermeasures, without fear of being made into criminals—it is difficult to answer the question of whether hacking back has deterrent value, which is an empirical question. More to the ideological point of Graves's bill, Lin points out that hacking back also won't do anything to restore security. By peddling the idea that hacking back could've stopped WannaCry -- ransomware -- ACDC is security snake oil. It's reminiscent of the \"anonymity box\" gold rush that hit Kickstarter after the Snowden snatch and dump, where charlatans sold \"Tor in a box\" promising that their gadgets would've prevented the Sony hack. Just take a recent, dimly-understood hacking disaster and graft on an infantile solution, don't bother to consult people in the trenches, and off we go. When you try to make laws about hacking based on a child's concept of \"getting someone back,\" you're getting very far and away from making yourself secure. It's like trying to make gang warfare productive. Or trying to make it legal to break into someone's house to steal your stuff back and take photos, because they broke into yours, except without anything in your favor of going right. Unless you're really, really good at different kinds of hacking. Spoiler: most everyone in hacking and security isn't, no matter how hard they try to make us all think all hackers are good at everything. It's a smarmy and conceited bill to propose. But that seems to be going around Washington DC lately, so good luck to us. Images: Yuri_Arcurs via Getty Images (Guys at computer); EFE/EPA/RITCHIE B.

Facebook fight fake news with links to other anglesPosted 5 minutes ago by Josh Constine StorySmall business loan platform Kabbage nabs $250M from SoftbankFacebook will become the suggester of perspective to avoid being the “arbiter of truth”. It’s rolling out “Related Articles” that appear below news links to stories lots of people are posting about on Facebook, or that are suspected to be false news and have been externally fact checked by Facebook’s partners. Appearing before someone reads, Related Articles will surface links to additional reporting on the same topic to provide different view points, and to truthiness reports from the fact checkers. If users see drastically different angles when they compare a story to its Related Articles, they might deem it suspicious and skip it, be less likely to believe or share it, or could click through the Related Articles and make up their own mind. That could reduce the spread and impact of false news without Facebook itself having to be the honesty police. Related Articles could also balance out some of the radical invective that can subtly polarize the populace. Pre-click Related Articles are rolling out in the US, Germany, France, and Nederlands today. These countries were chosen to get the roll out first because Facebook has established fact checking partnerships there. “We don’t want to be and are not the arbiters of the truth. The fact checkers can give the signal of whether a story is true or false” says Facebook News Feed integrity product manager Tessa Lyons. Meanwhile, Facebook’s machine learning algorithm has improved its accuracy and speed, so the social network will now have it send more potential hoaxes to fact checkers. Lyons explains that the speed is important because “The sooner we can get potential false new stories to fact checkers, the sooner that they can review them, and the more we reduce the number of people who are actually exposed to them. ”Facebook has shown Related Articles after people click links since at least 2014. Even then it was getting flack for dispensing fake news. In April of this year Facebook tested the new pre-click version as part of its multi-prong attack on fake news following criticism that misinformation influenced the 2016 U. S. presidential election. That includes downranking hoaxes and click bait, reducing referral traffic to ad-filled spam sites to cut off their funding, and promoting local journalism and news literacy. Most directly, it partnered with Snopes, AP, PolitiFact and others external agencies so it can add warning labels to stories externally vetted as false. “People told us that Related Articles gave them more context about topics and that having more context helps them make more informed decisions and about what they read and what they decide to share” Lyons tells me. “Seeing Fact Checker’s articles in Related Articles actually helps people identify whether what they’re reading is misleading or false. ”Facebook won’t be personalizing the Related Articles that show a column of thumbnail images and headlines below a link story. However, it does utilize other quality signals from News Feed ranking to show the optimal alternative takes. Thankfully, Lyons says Facebook doesn’t plan to put any ads in the Related Articles box. So how does Facebook avoid accidentally showing more fake news in Related Articles? Facebook tells me it uses the same signals as its Trending section, and disqualifies posts that lots of people are commenting on or reporting as false. No humans are involved in the process, which at least removes the potential for direct bias, though humans tend to code their subconscious biases into their algorithms. If Facebook can’t convince the world it’s got a real handle on the fake news problem, it may see people tune into the News Feed or click its links less. That interferes with Facebook’s ad-driven business model and its mission. Plus, it’s liable to get blamed for future election results. While objectively fake news gets the majority of the attention, it’s exaggeration and warped opinion that are much more prevalent and therefore potentially polarizing. If extreme right and left publishers’ articles get paired with centrist Related Articles, it could dissuade people from blindly swallowing the rants and raves that tear society apart. 13 hours ago |

KinjaToggle Conversation toolsGo to permalinkPhoto: Terje SollieWe’re helping readers save money all year long with the Lifehacker Ultimate Money Challenge. This month, we’re bringing back one of last year’s favorites: kick your spending weakness. We all have problem spending areas, and while we don’t want to keep you from spending money on things you enjoy, we do want to help you spend more mindfully. This means cutting back on things you buy impulsively then later regret. Your spending weakness might be restaurants. Or it could be gadgets. Or it might just be random daily deals. If you’re not sure what your weakness is, take a moment to look at your budget and analyze your spending. Maybe your finances are already optimized, but if you’re like most people, you have a few areas you can work on.

jobs better suited their skills. Timothy J. Seppala, @timseppala 1h ago in BusinessComments is investing $50 million to alter how we think about work. From throwing money at training in in-demand fields like coding, to simply making life easier for people in low-wage positions, Mountain View is looking to the future. For example, the internet juggernaut knows that college isn't for everyone, so it's working on a tool so people can easily compare vocational and technical training programs. Google hasn't specified how such a system will work, or how many training providers will be included, but in theory it'd put tech-ed programs alongside one another so you could find out which would suit your needs or offer the skills needed to land a job in your current city. Missing a day of work can dramatically alter a paycheck, so Google has partnered with the National Domestic Workers Alliance and its Alia program to assist low-income workers. Contributing a \"small\" amount of money each month means that if you're hurt, Alia will supplement your income so a sick day doesn't sting your checking account so badly. It sounds a lot like what Geico offers -- passive income when you're not able to clock in to work. And to help people find jobs in the first place, Google is giving money to French company Bayes Impact, which uses machine learning to analyze job-seeking strategies and listings to make finding your dream position less of a grind. Coupled with Google Hire, it hints that the firm might be ahead of the curve when it comes to modern employment.

Richard Lawler, @Rjcc 50m ago in GadgetryComments good morning! You look fabulous. Welcome to Thursday morning. We're reliving the '90s through, as Sega launches a selection of classic hits both with ads and without. We're also talking Instagram and its stealth shills, and new emoji. We hope you like fairies. It should focus less on surprise and more on delight. Apple's paranoia about leaks is misplacedApple's inability to keep its secrets is so bad that even its internal presentation about confidentiality leaked. It reportedly conducted an hour-long briefing titled \"Stopping Leakers -- Keeping Confidential at Apple\" for about 100 employees to make sure they understood the importance of not leaking information. But that concern is misplaced: Clamping down on leaks won't help Apple's bottom line. The games are free, but you can pay $2 to drop the advertisementsSega Forever makes Genesis classics free on mobileThe Sega Forever collection is five titles meant to begin \"a retro revolution that will transport players back through two decades of console gaming. \" Starting today, the 1991 version of Sonic the Hedgehog, fan-favorite RPG Phantasy Star II, classic arcade-style beat 'em up Comix Zone, platformer Kid Chameleon and Greek mythology-themed beat 'em up Altered Beast will be available on Google Play and iTunes as free ad-supported games. Can Travis Kalanick's resignation fix Uber? Uber's future is still tied to its founderUber's disruptive effect on the taxi business, went hand in hand with throwing out the rulebook. Some of the rules avoided, however, included strict background checks on drivers, and safety laws to ensure that drivers didn't work for too long, according to Uber co-founder Garrett Camp, who sits as chairperson of the company's board. He said the team \"failed to build some of the systems that every company needs to scale successfully. \" Those systems included restrictions on employees sexually harassing their colleagues and preventing engineers from developing tools to hinder law enforcement investigations. Following Travis Kalanick's resignation, can Uber change enough? Your next set of emoji includes zombies, vampires, fairies and dinosaurs. The latest emoji update is a playful oneFinally, the monocle emoji. A new tool could make hidden ads more obvious -- if shills use it. Instagram gives social media influencers the benefit of the doubtsocial media platform. The \"Paid partnership with [enter brand name here]\" post format is designed for users who want to advertise products on their page, letting them easily disclose when one of their posts is an ad. Instagram says this is an effort to bring the platform some much-needed transparency. The feature is set to roll out in the coming weeks to a \"small number\" of creators and businesses, according to the company. The question remains: Will influencers actually use the feature? And what will happen if they don't? The monsters caught with cheating tools may not behave normally. 'Pokémon Go' will flag creatures caught using cheatsNiantic has decided that forcing Pokémon Go cheaters to a life of catching Pidgeys isn't quite enough punishment. Now, any Pokémon caught using \"third-party services that circumvent normal gameplay\" will be marked with a slash in people's inventories and \"may not behave as expected. \"But wait, there's more.

as much as a Gear VR. Steve Dent, @stevetdent 17m ago in WearablesComments thousands of apps and Oculus behind it, Samsung's Gear VR is already a great virtual reality headset for Galaxy S8 and S8+ owners, and comes with a new controller to boot. It's always good to have more choice, though, and users of Samsung's flagship smartphones can now use Google's Daydream View, too. On a Google+ post, the search giant confirmed that \"the Daydream-ready update is rolling out now to Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+\" smartphones. While lagging behind Samsung in terms of games and apps, the Daydream View made a strong debut thanks in large part to its comfortable cloth construction. It also comes with a small motion controller, and when it was unveiled, the Gear VR didn't have one -- you had to buy a separate gamepad or make do with with a touchpad on the side of the headset. Shortly after the Daydream VR launch, Samsung unveiled a new Gear VR and controller for the Galaxy S8, S7 and S6 smartphones. The Galaxy S8 or S8+ confer the same benefits to the Daydream VR headset as to the Gear VR. Both phones have arguably the best AMOLED screens on the market with nearly the highest resolutions (2,960 x 1,440) for crisp viewing, fast processors to crunch games and plenty of RAM. They also feature expandable microSD storage up to 256GB -- indispensable for VR video files, which are often enormous. If you're looking at the Daydream VR, it's currently on sale for a limited time in the US at $60 instead of $80. The Daydream VR app is now available on Google Play and should work on your Galaxy S8 or S8+ with no OTA update necessary, users are reporting. If you're having trouble, some Reddit users say that you may need to clear Google VR Services data on your device, then re-open the Daydream app. Via: Droid Life Source: Google (Google+)In this article: Daydream, GalaxyS8, GalaxyS8Plus, gear, google, headset, mobile, samsung, VirtualReality, VR, wearables In 17m 17m ago in Wearables Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and S8+ now support Daydream View VR Google's headset currently costs half as much as a Gear VR.

Busiest Airports Means a Never-Ending Line of RootgizmodoRush Hour at One of the World's Busiest Airports Means a Never-Ending Line of AirplanesCasey ChanToday 7:50pmFiled to: to KinjaToggle Conversation toolsGo to permalinkGIF London’s Heathrow Airport is one of the busiest airports in the world, so it’s no surprise that if you look up in the sky during the morning rush, you’ll see a line of airplanes swarming around, patiently waiting to land on its runways. This video from TopFelya shows 30 minutes of morning arrivals and there’s a plane coming in every other minute.

Handling air traffic control at Heathrow must be a never ending game of stress.

Mariella Moon, @mariella_moon 1h ago in Food and DrinkComments Dorfman/MIT CSAILImagine an app that can help you figure out how to replicate what you're eating in a restaurant and help track your calorie intake just by taking a picture of your plate. A team of MIT CSAIL researchers have developed an artificial intelligence system that has the potential to evolve into that kind of application. They call the AI Pic2Recipe, because it can predict the ingredients and recipe used to make a dish from a single snapshot. If that sounds familia, it's probably because of \"See Food,\" the fictional app that made an appearance in HBO's Silicon Valley, and a new-ish Pinterest feature that recognizes the most prominent ingredients in a picture of food. Other teams and institutions are also working on similar projects, and a common issue is the lack of samples that leads to limited accuracy. The team had to scour various social networks and websites, such as All Recipes and Food, to collect 1 million recipes. They then annotated the collection with more information about their ingredients and used the database to train a neural network. The result? Their system can identify ingredients like like flour, eggs and butter and can spit out the correct recipe for the dish in an image 65 percent of the time. CSAIL graduate student and lead author Nick Hynes explains:\"This could potentially help people figure out what's in their food when they don't have explicit nutritional information. For example, if you know what ingredients went into a dish but not the amount, you can take a photo, enter the ingredients, and run the model to find a similar recipe with known quantities, and then use that information to approximate your own meal. \"Before you can use it as part of your fitness regimen, though, the team still has to work on making it more accurate. They're also developing its ability to infer how a dish is prepared and to distinguish one ingredient from another. You can put the AI to the test yourself if you want -- just upload a pic on the team's demo website or click one of the available images.

TeethAndrew Liszewski4 minutes agoFiled to: EffectsDisney Research ZurickDisney ResearchETH ZurichMax Planck Institute for to KinjaToggle Conversation toolsGo to permalinkGIF As we work towards crossing the uncanny valley so that computer-generated humans don’t look like horrific plastic mannequins, every last facial feature needs to be recreated perfectly. That even includes teeth, which can now be digitized using nothing but a video of someone methods used for creating believable CG teeth involved either modeling every last one from scratch, or using an intra-oral scanner to capture accurate digital copies which can be awkward and uncomfortable for a performer. What researchers at Disney Research Zurich, ETH Zurich, and the Max Planck Institute for Informatics have instead created is a non-invasive tool that can recreate a subject’s teeth by simply analyzing short videos, or even just photographs of their open mouth. Since most photographs and videos of a person don’t reveal every last tooth inside their mouths, the researchers developed a system that matches visible teeth to a catalog of existing tooth models, and then based on those matches, automatically generates the rest of the occluded teeth to match with appropriate sizes and shapes. The research could help streamline everything from the creation of visual-effect laden Hollywood blockbusters, to multi-million dollar video game franchises, making it easier and cheaper to create convincing computer-generated characters to either fool audiences, or just make an experience more Research]Andrew EditorYou thought Disney only made cartoons and theme parks?

agoFiled to: prince lestatprince lestat and the realms of atlantisvampiresanne to KinjaToggle Conversation toolsGo to permalinkWhen you think of vampires, chances are you think of Anne Rice’s Lestat—gothic, beautiful, tortured, romantic, everything that has practically defined the creatures in pop culture since Rice wrote Interview With the Vampire in 1976. But in her new book, the unusually titled Prince Lestat and the Realms of Atlantis (out today), Rice has shockingly redefined her own creation—and she told io9 why. AdvertisementAs I mentioned last week, I’ve been dying to talk about Realms of Atlantis because of how mind-boggling it is, but also how daring—even to me, someone who hadn’t read a Vampire Chronicles book in more than two decades. Honestly, in terms of how much it up-ends its own mythology, I’m hard-pressed to think of another spoiler that changes its universe more fundamentally. But I have to reveal it in order for the interview to make sense, so consider this an I really want to make sure no one who wants to avoid spoilers sees AdvertisementAliens have arrived in The Vampire Chronicles. Well, more specifically, they arrived thousands of years ago, but they are hugely responsible for the existence of all vampires, as well as Atlantis. Before Realms of Atlantis, Lestat and his brethren only knew that the vampire’s curse came to be when a bloodthirsty spirit named Amel possessed the ancient Egyptian queen Akasha (the titular Queen of the Damned). It is Amel’s spirit that can be passed from vampire to vampire, connecting them all, and giving vampires their powers and weaknesses. In Prince Lestat (2014), it’s discovered that Amel is still conscious in this neural vampire network, but primarily residing in the spiritual core of the vampires… which Lestat has absorbed after the defeat of Akasha. But Amel is not a spirit… at least not originally. As Realms reveals, he is also the founder of Atlantis, a coastal city of unbelievably advanced technology, around 10,000 years ago. The reason he’s so smart is because he was abducted by aliens named Bravennans, modified, and sent to Earth for reasons I won’t spoil. When he rebels the aliens destroy Atlantis, and Amel somehow becomes a spirit, but he also fuses with a special Atlantean technology that ends up forming the essence of everything that makes a vampire a vampire—an essence that can be measured and altered don’t expect everyone to like Rice’s massive, massive alteration to her mythos, but I genuinely enjoyed the book, and I loved the audacity of it. It was fascinating to see the classic, gothic world of Lestat suddenly, completely upended—but also to see the vampires engaging and embracing the modern world, forming a real community, and, most of all, discovering that their existence, which they once thought to be a divine curse, is actually the result of science—otherworldly science, but science all the same. (And guys? There are so many more surprises I didn’t spoil. )But all of this is preamble. Let Rice herself explain why the Realms of Atlantis contains these shocking revelations, why Rice thinks people shouldn’t be surprised, and what comes next for Lestat.

Well, I [started] all this with a great emphasis on gothic romance. I wanted these vampires to be dressed in black velvet, wearing white lace. I wanted them to be beautiful and seductive. I wanted them to be like the movie I saw as a child, called Dracula’s Daughter (1936). It involved this gothic, beautiful, sensitive, wonderful countess who was in fact the daughter of Dracula, and she was an artist living in London and it was a very romantic presentation of the vampire as a tortured soul. And I loved that. And that was where I was at in the beginning; I wanted these beautiful, irresistible tragic characters to appeal to the reader and for the reader to fall in love with them. But I have never seen science fiction as in any way anathema to this. Very early on, I did a signing in a science fiction bookstore in 1976, and those science fiction readers who came to that store, they took the vampires absolutely seriously. It was amazing. They walked in and they asked metaphysical questions about Louis’ quest for meaning. And I just had such respect for very aware of this scifi world, [so I know] it dips a lot into—maybe not the gothic, but it tips into poetry. I mean, Robert Heinlein’s stories are just filled with poetry. Ray Bradbury is filled with poetic meaning. And it’s so—to me, there was always this reverence to science fiction. So I don’t have any fear of going there. My vampires are so real to me, their gothic allure is so well-established that I don’t feel in any way threatened by the hard cult science of science fiction. I go for the metaphysical and poetic side of science fiction. So, it’s exciting to me to work with both. It really is. And you know, I hope maybe some scifi readers will give this book a chance whereas maybe they weren’t interested in vampire fiction you worried that some fans might be put off on changing the vampires’ origin from something supernatural to something I’ve always been looking for that bottom line. I’m always going back to where it all started, and discovering more about “how” it started. This [continues] the process. It’s just digging back even further. Like, what was this entity that came to Akasha? What was it before? Where did it come from? And so to me it’s all very logical and it’s all of a might be disappointed. They might have been hoping for a more religious or a more purely mysterious explanation, but I’ve never actually offered that to readers. I’ve always offered the biological reality for these palpable beings. They occupy space. They are subject to physical rules, just as we are. That, to me, is the great dramatic tension. They have to deal with physical limitations even though they appear to be supernatural. They aren’t. They’re preternatural. What we think of as the supernatural maybe isn’t supernatural at all. It’s not the abolition of everything we believe in the material world—it’s another dimension of the material world that we have yet to really beyond the big reveal about Atlantis and the aliens, the book doesn’t come close to answering all the mysteries in the series. Correct me if I’m wrong, but there are still ghosts, and there are spirits besides them, and their origin is still unknown. Rice: Where did the spirits come from? And the story of Amel—do we know the full truth? Or is there yet more to be discovered? Is Amel wrong about some of the things he thinks about himself and where he came from? Was Amel the victim of lies about always dealing with that idea of where the soul comes from. Can a droid have a soul, simply because of awareness? Can it generate a soul? Is a soul made of nanoparticles? All of that I think is important. But do you already know the answers to these mysteries? The origins of ghosts and spirits in your world? Rice: I have questions. My questions bump up against the reality that humans just don’t know. I mean, that’s something I live with at my age now, that I do not know what happens after death, if anything happens after death. I do not know and I can’t know and frankly I don’t believe people that tell me they know. So I don’t know that I can ever offer to the readers an absolute explanation for something as the real reason for why we’re here and where we came from—I don’t think that’s I can certainly ask a lot of really interesting questions. And I can imagine a lot of very interesting beings based on what we know of ghosts, apparitions, possession and so forth. Are there any other details you can tell us about Lestat’s future, and/or the next He’ll still be the prince and he’ll still be at the chateau and he will still have his closest confidants there. He will have Marius and Armand and Louis and Fareed and Gregory and he will confront yet another huge threat. And the threats that they’re confronting are coming out of the internet age. They’re confronting the fact that the internet age is enabling immortals and occult beings to come together as never before. It’s enabling them to find each other, it’s enabling them to talk to each other—so they’re confronting—the crises they’re confronting are modern crises. And I think that’s a thrilling idea. I like the idea of bringing all that charm and beauty and enchantment into the present time and fusing it with the modern challenges. And think of what the internet must mean to ghosts and spirits, my god. They can find each other. They can find other entities like themselves for whom they may have been divided for very much a theme in Prince Lestat, too. How is the internet impacting all of this? Little vampire Benjy is one of my favorite characters. He’s 12 years old when he’s made a vampire, and he’s a Bedouin from the nation of Israel. And he has a sense of tribe and a sense of tribal loyalties and he starts using the internet to reach other vampires and to talk to the whole world of vampires—and in a sense, he helps bring them together as a worldwide tribe. And that’s very much behind these books. Before the Atlantis reveal, I was shocked to see not just how much vampires had embraced the modern age, and how positively, but also how they’d formed an actual community together. It’s so different from the original books, but it’s also clearly a part of the original Vampire Chronicles. Rice: That’s true. There was a story unfolding about the past and now it’s the present, it goes even deeper into the past to find answers, but also to better live in the present. To better define themselves in the present. You know, in the past they sometimes got answers and they’re just left with despair, you know? The next Prince Lestat book, as I call them—the next one will also be named “Prince Lestat and. ”—will also be a book where the past is seen entirely in the terms of the vigorous and vital existence of the you anticipate the next book or books containing a bombshell as world-changing as Realms of Atlantis has? Rice: I don’t know. I’m not sure. If other things open up as I’m writing, maybe so. The thing with me is to surrender. To surrender to where it goes. To establish the reality for myself—these characters exist, they’re really there, they’re talking to me—and to see where they’re taking me. And it’s possible there would be another know, until you said that word, “bombshell,” I didn’t really see it that way. So I don’t know. I think the next one could perhaps be as radical. Would that be the word? Is it possible? It’s possible. What I don’t want to lose right now—and I never want to lose—is the court and Lestat as the prince as the community. I don’t want to lose that again. And I’m not going to risk it. I’ve done that in the past. I’ve risked it. I’ve thrown it away at the end of books. Because I had to! It didn’t sustain for me. It just didn’t. And I was so beaten up on by what happened in the book that I crawled out of the book and didn’t take anything positive with me. But that’s not the way it is now. Last question. I originally meant this to be a little silly, based on the unexpectedness of Atlantis, but after our discussion. could you envision a story in which Lestat went to the moon? AdvertisementRice: I wouldn’t rule it out. I might go in that direction. I wouldn’t say he’s going to the moon, necessarily, but… it could happen. This book has opened up the possibilities of extraterrestrial life. I wouldn’t rule it out. I want to see what happens. If there’s going to be an explanation of what happens to a vampire’s physiology in space, given that days and nights simply don’t exist, there’s no one better to answer that question than you. Rice: Well that’s great. That’s wonderful. I appreciate that very much. If I’ll have an answer, I don’t know. but I am very excited about getting into this [next] book. It’s too early to know for sure which way it’s going to go. I’ve got some ideas, I’ve got a map. but I don’t know where I’ll land.

SommelierPatrick Allan47 minutes agoFiled to: to KinjaToggle Conversation toolsGo to permalinkThere’s nothing more romantic than wine and chocolate—as long as the pairing is right. Here are some useful suggestions from an expert in the field. In this video, Madeline Puckette, sommelier and founder of Wine Folly, shares her picks for great chocolate and wine pairings. For basic chocolates, especially the dark stuff, Puckette suggests a nice, sweet port. For chocolate cakes, cupcakes, and the like, reach for a bottle of shiraz. And if you’re more of a white chocolate fan—which isn’t really chocolate, but still—a dry sauvignon blanc will elevate the vanilla flavoring of the white chocolate to an irresistible fruitiness. Of course, if you’re reaching for the basic stuff in the candy aisle, there are plenty of other pairing suggestions out there.  \n","42

Pro Was DOA GuideMy New $2,500 MacBook Pro Was DOA Alex Cranz33 minutes agoFiled to: AppleMacBook Procrash to KinjaToggle Conversation toolsGo to permalinkImage: Alex Cranz/GizmodoDamn this new MacBook Pro. As of this very moment I’ve had the new 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar for just a few hours. It’s small, sturdy, and typing my password in was pleasant enough. That Touch Bar looks really neat too, and when I set up Touch ID to login from the Touch Bar, I felt like I was in the $2,500 worth of overpriced, hyper-engineered Apple laptop has now crashed 23 times—a full dozen in the first hour I had this thing. The last 11 crashes occurred more sporadically because I spent the last hour and a half on three different calls with Apple in an effort to resolve the problem. I will say that the company’s tech support personnel were very kind and contacting them was easy. You sign in to your Apple account on the support website, answer a question, and a call is scheduled. The website had me run a few tests while Apple sets up the call, then your phone rings, and there’s a gracious member of tech support on the first representative guided me through resetting my PRAM and arranged a callback. The computer crashed. Rep Two had me reinstall the OS. The computer crashed. Rep Three saw the detailed notes and immediately said I needed to speak to a MacBook Supervisor (whatever that is). I was then placed on hold for ten minutes. The MacBook Supervisor took one look at the issue and put me in contact with the internet sales team. So tomorrow I will pack up my brand new MacBook Pro. It will not be hard, apart from keeping the device stable enough to remove all my personal information. The charger never even came out of its wrapper. The box is still sitting on top of its packaging on my bed, cellophane shining. I’ll get a new MacBook Pro eventually. First, I have to ship Apple the old and wait for FedEx to tell Apple I’ve shipped it. Then Apple will “start building” me a new one. There is no guarantee of a ship date. Maybe December. Maybe is standard operating procedure for Apple, and it makes sense for a company that deals in millions of phones every year. But a $2,500 “custom built” laptop is a far cry from a $600 smartphone. The expectations are higher for that customer base. We expect things like a device that works out of the box—particularly when it’s supposedly “custom built. ” If I’m spending $2,500, and they’re specially installing RAM and an i7 processor is it really too much to ask that they test the damn thing before it leaves the factory? There are plenty of smaller companies with cheaper products that do just that. Once upon a time the splurging for an Apple product felt worth it. You were paying for an outstanding operating system and a breezy computing experience, as well as the best tech support in the game. A new computer would have been shipped the moment the return label was created for the old one. Or they might have even encouraged a visit to an Apple Store, where a tech would have been able to physically repair the my new “custom built” laptop arrived DOA. I’m not the only one with problems, either. While the new 13-inch MacBook Pro only started arriving in users’ hands today, the 15-inch had a few days head start, and numerous owners have flocked to the MacRumors forum to crow about “GPUGate. ” Those fancy and woefully underpowered video cards? Are creating some massive glitches on the display. Are you suffering from GPUGate? Did your shiny new laptop also come DOA? Shoot me an email at I’d love to hear more. Alex Editor.

Your SD Card and Save Space on Your CentsVitalsApp directoryGearHow to Download Netflix Movies to Your SD Card and Save Space on Your PhoneEric RavenscraftToday 10:00amFiled to: netflixandroidsd cardsmoviestv showsfile to KinjaToggle Conversation toolsGo to permalinkRejoice, you can download Netflix movies and TV shows to watch offline. Unfortunately, it only downloads to your built-in storage by default, which can lead to some slow, cluttered phones. If you’d rather use the extra space on your SD card for all those Stranger Things episodes, here’s how. Method #1: Copy Everything to Your SD Card ManuallyYou’ll need to label them yourself, but you can copy Netflix videos easily. The safest way to copy Netflix videos to your SD card is also the most tedious. When Netflix downloads a movie, it’s stored in a nondescript folder on your phone’s built-in storage. You can copy these to your SD card temporarily to save space, but you’ll need to copy them back whenever you want to watch them. Still, it’s a handy way to store extra movies or shows for later, like a long flight or car trip when you’ll have nothing else to do. AdvertisementWhen you download movies or TV shows to your phone, the files on your device won’t have descriptive names, so you’re not going to get or anything. Instead, you’ll see a folder with a long, seemingly-random number. If you want to keep a tidy, organized library, download one episode or movie at a time and follow these steps:Open your preferred file manager (we recommend Solid Explorer. )Turn on the option to show hidden files and folders, if you haven’t already. (To do this in Solid Explorer, tap the menu button while browsing, tap “Folder options” then check “Show hidden files. ”)Navigate to Device Storage > Android > data > > files > Download > . ofHere you’ll see a folder named with a string of numbers. Long-press the folder and tap the scissors icon to cut it to the clipboard. Slide out the left-hand panel in Solid Explorer and tap your SD card. Navigate to the folder you want to store the files in. Tap the circular clipboard icon in the lower-right corner to paste the files. Rename the numbered Netflix folder to add the name of the movie or TV show you just downloaded to the end, but do not delete the number. You’ll need this later. When you want to watch your movie or TV show again, copy the folder back to its original location in step 3. Delete the label you added earlier so only the number remains. If you rename or change any of the files in the . of folder, Netflix won’t recognize or play them. You can add labels while you store them on your SD card temporarily, but you’ll need to put every file and folder back where you found it with exactly the same names. Admittedly, this process is cumbersom—and Netflix might issue an update that blocks it entirely—but it does allow you to store a lot more downloads than you can fit on your internal you have an OTG cable—like this one you can buy for less than $5—you can use this same process to store files on flash drives or even external hard drives. If you’re going to go this route, though, your drive will need to use the exFAT file system. If you’re not familiar with it, we explain what it is and how to use it here. This isn’t exactly a convenient way to store movies, but if you already have a properly formatted drive and you want to save some shows for a road trip, this is a handy workaround. Method #2: Set Up Your SD Card As Shared StorageIt’s a bit like your phone and SD card are getting married. Technically, Netflix stores downloaded movies on what’s called your “primary shared storage. ” By default, that means your phone’s built-in storage, but you can let your phone “adopt” an SD card to make that space even bigger. There are a few downsides to this method. First, this will reformat your SD card. Before you proceed, you’ll need to back up anything that’s on your SD card. If you’ve already installed apps to your SD card, you should move them back to your phone’s storage for now and back up any data (like photos) in those apps that you can’t recover later. Ideally, you’d follow these steps with a fresh SD this can slow your whole phone down if you’re using a slow SD card. Internal storage is faster than some SD cards. When you force apps to install on the card, you can make them slower to launch or run because it takes longer to read that data. Make sure you’re using a fast SD card (like a Class 6 card) if you don’t want to take a performance hit. Finally, once you adopt an SD card, you should never remove it. Android will treat your SD card like it’s part of your phone’s built-in storage space. That means important files will be stored on your card and you can break things if you remove it. If you go this route, be prepared to treat that SD card like it can’t be removed from your that said, to turn your SD card into adopted storage, follow these steps:Insert your SD card into your device. If it’s already inserted, remove it then reinsert it. A notification will appear indicating a new drive is detected. Tap “Set Up” in this notification. Tap “Use as internal storage. ” This step will erase the SD card. You’ll now be prompted to move extra data to your new storage. You can do this now, or do it later under Settings > Storage > SD Card > Migrate DataYou can choose to do step 4 later, but you’ll probably want to do it before downloading Netflix movies and TV shows. After you adopt the SD card into your built-in storage, Android will treat it like one big drive. All your apps will start using the space on your SD card seamlessly, including Netflix. You won’t even notice a difference as you download every single season of Orange Is the New Black. Eric Writer for Lifehacker.

Reader to Keep Your Data SafeAndrew LiszewskiToday 10:42amFiled to: Kong Baptist UniversityLip to KinjaToggle Conversation toolsGo to permalinkDespite being the most common way to protect computers and sensitive data, passwords are a terrible security solution. So scientists at Hong Kong Baptist University are teaching computers to read a user’s lips as a far more secure method of biometric a password that’s both unique enough to be secure and simple enough to remember is getting harder and harder. That’s why many laptops and smartphones include fingerprint readers for an added layer of biometric security. However, faking fingerprints is easier than you might think, so Cheung Yiu-ming, a professor at the university’s computer science department, wants computers and smartphones to use the unique movements of a user’s lips while they say their password as another layer of authentication. The feature would only work on devices with a user-facing camera, but it would offer advantages over voice-based authentication, which can be tripped up by background noise and other sounds, is often language-specific, and simply doesn’t work for those with a speech impairment. The lip-reading approach, which tracks lip shape, movement, and even texture, could be used almost anywhere. It would also be virtually impossible for someone else to mimic, as those qualities are unique to every new approach would still require a user to remember a spoken passphrase, which would be hard to keep secret given this technology is proposed for use with ATMs and other machines that reside in very public places. But even if someone overhears what you’ve said, it should be impossible for them to fool a device—unless they happen to be your twin.

But Branson has a new idea for the meantime: Why not launch small satellites into space? Called Virgin Orbit, Branson’s newest space venture will be led by former Boeing executive Dan Hart. “By offering low cost and frequent service to space, the team is revolutionizing the small satellite market within the promising space economy,” Branson bragged on his blog.AdvertisementBranson’s space strategy, however, is a little odd, so we’ve come up with a name for it: The Reverse Musk™. How do you pull off a Reverse Musk™? You start with the really hard stuff and then give up and try the more humble projects you should’ve been working on two decades ago.Elon Musk founded SpaceX in 2002 with bold dreams of eventually propelling humans into space—to Mars and beyond. But Musk realized that you had to start with the more modest stuff. Over the next decade, SpaceX built rockets and sent capsules to the International Space Station, and launched satellites.And all of those things paid off. Musk now talks about how he wants to send space tourists around the moon by the end of 2018. And even though it’s a tremendously ambitious goal, some people believe he can do it. Why? Musk started with the “smaller” stuff like launching satellites. Getting humans to the moon and Mars may have been the ultimate goal, but Musk clearly knew that you had to learn to walk before you could run.SponsoredBranson has always been about the opposite. Yes, he’s been developing his own rockets, and spaceships—one that tragically and infamously exploded in 2014, killing a pilot. But he only recently pursued private contracts to do the more modest stuff, like launching satellites into space, that ultimately teaches lessons that you can use for manned space travel. Branson did, however, get the state of New Mexico to pay $250 million for a spaceship graveyard. So it’s not like he wasn’t busy spending other people’s money. Just not in a way that benefited very many people.AdvertisementAdvertisement“It has been my longheld dream to open access to space to change the world for good,” Branson said in a statement about his new company. “We have been striving to do that by manufacturing vehicles of the future, enabling the small satellite revolution, and preparing commercial space flight for many more humans to reach space and see our home planet.”“I’m thrilled that our small satellite launch service has now progressed to the point it merits the formation of its own company, Virgin Orbit, and a new president in Dan  with decades of deep experience and success in a broad variety of space programs.”Will Virgin Orbit be successful? Hopefully. But it’s really something he should’ve started with back in the 2000s.Advertisement“Virgin Galactic officials said 100 people already have paid $200,000 apiece to fly into space,” a story from the Associated Press in 2005 promised. “They include actress Victoria Principal, who told the news conference she looked forward to being on the first civilian flight of Virgin Galactic, perhaps as soon as 2008.”Like we said, we’re still rooting for Branson’s The Reverse Musk™, even if he has almost 20 years of failed promises in his wake. Hopefully this one takes off. Do you get it? I said, I hope this one takes off. Like the spaceships.

There was the Smart Ultra 6, which was one of the best affordable phones of its time, and the Smart Platinum 7, which was an interesting step into more expensive, sub-flagship category. But alongside those, there have been a number of humdrum handsets that failed to impress. As per its yearly update cycle, Vodafone recently released new own-brand hardware, with the Smart V8 in particular slotting into the carrier's roster as one of the best affordable options.            Gallery: Vodafone Smart V8 | 16 Photos                       16                                +12                    The most immediately striking feature of the Smart V8 when you free it from its box is the build quality. It's almost entirely brushed metal aside from two pockets of textured plastic, with neatly chamfered edges and loudspeaker grilles. While it's not pushing the boundaries of design by any means, it certainly looks and feels like it's punching above the £159 pay-as-you-go price point.The spec sheet isn't to be taken lightly either. You're looking at a 5.5-inch, 1080p LCD display, an octa-core 1.4GHz Snapdragon 435, 3 gigs of RAM, 32GB of expandable storage, a 16-megapixel primary camera and 8MP front-facer, all powered by a decent-sized 3,000mAh battery. You also get a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor and NFC chip -- hello Android Pay. Perhaps even more important, the Smart V8 is running Android 7.1.1, so it's basically as up-to-date as you can get on the software front.It's more or less the stock Android experience, albeit with a few borderline-bloatware apps from Vodafone added in. One quirk I've discovered worth noting is I can't seem to resize widgets on the homescreen. Not a huge deal, but it does mean the digital clock widget is naturally off-centre, which is slightly irritating.In sunny summer conditions, the 16MP camera can be pretty handy. Good colour saturation, clarity, and contrast thanks to the HDR mode. The app is pretty busy with filters and features and settings, from full manual control to long exposure and \"active photo\" modes (kinda like GIFs/Live Photos). You won't find much help in them in low-light conditions, though, where the camera begins to fall off fairly quickly.             Gallery: Vodafone Smart V8 camera samples | 13 Photos                       13                                +9                    All in all, there's nothing particularly special about the Smart V8. These days, metalwork, this kind of spec sheet and value-added features like fingerprint sensor and NFC are becoming standard at the mid-to-low end. The new handset does have something going for it, though -- a pretty competitive price tag.Vodafone's pay-as-you-go range is relatively sparse around the £150 mark. You've got the £149 Sony Xperia L1, which is less attractive enough on paper to justify the jump to the £159 Smart V8. The closest handset beyond that point is the fairly comparable £199 Huawei P8 lite (2017). The Moto G5 gets a nod too, obviously, as well as the Wileyfox Swift 2, since they can be bought elsewhere for bang on £159. You wouldn't say either of them are significantly better than the Smart V8, though.Smart N8If you've set yourself a slightly tighter budget, Vodafone also recently launched the Smart N8, an £85 handset sitting in the crowded low-end of the pay-as-you-go spectrum. It's more than appropriately specced, with a 5-inch, 720p display, quad-core 1.3GHz MediaTek chip, 1.5GB of RAM, 16 gigs of expandable storage, 13- and 5-megapixel cameras, fingerprint sensor, NFC and 2,400mAh battery.Despite looking a little on the drab side, it's a decent value device. You could always save yourself a London pint and opt for the £79 Moto G4 Play instead, which recently began receiving Android Nougat, but you would be sacrificing the fingerprint reader/NFC combo. But that's true of most other devices dipping below the £100 marker at the moment.Smart Tab N8While the two smartphones have obvious places in Vodafone's backroom, the new Smart Tab N8 is where things get confusing. The draw of pretty much all own-brand tablets is ultimate portability, thanks to 4G, at a reasonable cost. I wouldn't call the Smart Tab N8 very portable though, because it's massive. It's not that heavy at 465g and it's pretty thin, too, with 8.95mm between the glass front and textured, tactile plastic back -- it's that it's all face.             Gallery: Vodafone Smart Tab N8 | 9 Photos                       9                                +5                    Not only does the slate carry a 10.1-inch display, but a significant bloating of bezel around it. It's not something you could slip into a handbag and it not be a nuisance, let's say. Worse yet, that 10.1-inch screen runs at a very noticeable 1,280 x 800 resolution, making it easy to pick out individual pixels. Large tablets are typically geared more towards entertainment, but 149 ppi doesn't really cut it nowadays.The other specs are largely irrelevant: A quad-core 1.1GHz MediaTek processor, 2 gigs of RAM, 16GB of expandable storage, 4,600mAh battery and 5MP/2MP cameras on the appropriate sides. Vodafone is selling the Smart Tab N8 on contracts starting at £16 per month for a 5GB data cap and no upfront payment. I'd sooner get exactly the same plan with Samsung's 10.1-inch Galaxy Tab A (2016), since it's been upgraded to Nougat already and waves a more alluring spec sheet, the 1,920 x 1,200 display being the most important upgrade. Hits and misses for Vodafone again, it would appear.

Apple VP of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives Lisa Jackson knows this perfectly well as she’s responsible for making sure that Apple doesn’t make any compromise in favor of unrestrained growth. That’s why we’re excited to talk with Lisa Jackson on stage at Disrupt SF 2017 about the other side of tech.Jackson’s role at Apple encompasses so many different things. She’s the one responsible for minimizing Apple’s impact on the environment. Apple is building data centers that run 100 percent on renewable energy. But it is also concerned about the impact of its retail stores and offices.Apple also sells tens of millions of devices every quarter. The company needs to make sure that it comes in tiny packages so that it uses fewer planes, boats and trucks. And those packages are made out of paper. The company is trying to protect forests used in the production of paper packaging for Apple items.The company doesn’t want to mine the Earth until there’s no resources left. Apple is trying to use recycled material as much as possible in order to protect the Earth. And of course, Apple is trying to get back and recycle as many broken or unused devices at the end of their life cycle as possible.Apple is not perfect and it definitely feels like a work in progress, but Apple is also communicating a lot on those issues and regularly sharing updates about their various environmental projects.And protecting the Earth is just one aspect. Jackson is also trying to protect human rights and looking at Apple’s social impact. That’s why Apple stopped relying on cobalt from Congo after learning about child labor. The company is working with so many different suppliers that it needs to implement strong processes to find out if everyone is paid fairly under acceptable working conditions.Social issues aren’t limited to factories overseas. Tech companies have a responsibility when it comes to hiring and promoting a diverse pool of talent. That’s why Apple appointed its first-ever VP of Diversity and Inclusion Denise Young Smith earlier this year.And finally, Apple and other tech companies have become so big that they have a responsibility when it comes to policy changes. Everybody remembers the San Bernardino encryption case — Apple took a strong stance against the FBI and in favor of privacy.Under President Donald Trump’s administration, Silicon Valley leaders often strongly disagree with some of his decisions or tweets. It’s going to be interesting to discuss how Silicon Valley can have a say in those decisions.If you want to hear our discussion with Lisa Jackson, grab an early-bird ticket to Disrupt.

Breathe the gas out through your nose or mouth, and voilà, man becomes dragon.AdvertisementIts popularity is not due to its taste. Dragon’s Breath is, in fact, kind of disgusting. When fresh, it tastes kind of like fruit loops, but most of the time Dragon’s Breath is served stale, its taste more reminiscent of cardboard. The appeal comes instead from its aesthetics.

The Raindrop Cake, a weekend pop-up started by an advertising guy, has been so successful that its creator recently quit his day job to focus on making tasteless gelatinous cakes full-time.“Food has become an accessible status symbol,” said food futurist Anna Griggs.AdvertisementOver the last year or two, she told me, she’s noticed a significant uptick in foods that are popular for reasons besides taste. “It’s something that we’ve been seeing across categories—in food, fashion, makeup. It’s the popularization of these looks that are just designed to be photographed for Instagram,” she said. “People will wait in line for hours just to get a photo of a Black Tap milkshake. You put in the time and effort to wait in line and get the shot. And then people want the validation of the likes and comments.”“Food has become an accessible status symbol.” Pretty food, of course, is not new. Throughout history—and especially among the upper crust—certain dishes have proven popular mainly because of their elaborate presentations. In the 19th Century, Mrs. Beeton’s Book of Household Management suggested that the Victorian middle class arrange their salads to look like elaborate cakes. The Victorians were also obsessed with jellies, a gastronomic craze more about wobbling, high-stacked spectacle than taste.Victorian salad arrangement advice.

Back in 2014, the New York Times food critic Pete Wells coined this “camera cuisine,” noting that at high-end eateries in particular, its rise seemed intrinsically linked to a decline in taste.AdvertisementAdvertisement“A side effect of the digital age in food photography, camera cuisine is any dish that was inspired by a picture or aspires to be one,” he wrote. “Like any genre of cooking, camera cuisine varies widely in quality, but in its purest form it is both exquisitely photogenic and peculiarly bland and lifeless.”What’s new, Griggs told me, is that this obsession with a meal’s aesthetics has now filtered into mass culture. The fixation has in turn prompted purveyors of food to cater to Instagram’s foodie set. At the top of its menu, New York City’s Empellón include a message noting that “Empellón strongly discourages the use of cellphones, unless you’re posting food porn on Instagram. #Empellon.” Several times, I’ve seen restaurant chefs spot a food-photographing diner and pull them into a spot with better lighting and restaurants now dole out free meals to Instagram “influencers” for a shot at going viral.

His Raindrop Cake, made from a gelatin-like substance called agar, was inspired by mizu shingen mochi, a Japanese dessert he discovered online.“The cake itself is really about texture,” he told me. “For most people with an American palate, taste is the most important thing. But in many Asian dishes, the dish is really built around texture. I didn’t approach this as a food item. I approached it as an experience. It doesn’t matter what it tastes like.”AdvertisementAdvertisementWong went to Japan and studied the dessert, then spent months trying to create a cake that almost perfectly resembled an oversized raindrop, a cake that would be like eating water. He debuted it at Smorgasborg in Brooklyn last March to much acclaim. Wong credits social media, and in particular Instagram, almost entirely for its success.Food, though, has always been about more than just the taste of what we put in how mouths. We also value the atmosphere of a restaurant, or the company of family and friends. Maybe Instagram has just shown us another way to enjoy food—taking in not just how it looks, but the social media conversation those aesthetics spur.“I did think a lot about visuals when I launched it,” Wong told me. “The majority of my customers, the first thing they do before taking a bite is take a photo.”Kristen V.

Indeed, while he’s not sure how much he can do to help Cloudflare, which has a Boston office, a bill that Senator Lesser helped craft will be heard in committee next Tuesday, and it would put a serious crimp in what he calls “shakedown operations” more broadly.More from a conversation we had this morning, edited for length:TC: You’re on the young side to be a state senator.EL: I’d gone to Harvard, then Harvard Law School, and in my third year, I decided to jump into a race in the community where I grew up, and I won. It was a five-way primary, and very close. I think I won by 192 votes out of around 17,000. [Laughs.]TC: When did you zero in on this patent problem?EL: In Massachusetts, you serve two-year terms, and after I was reelected to my second term, a friend who I was friendly with in college was at HBS and he sort of said, “There’s this thing that’s starting to create real issues,” and it was patent trolling. I’d had a very atmospheric knowledge of it from law school and IP classes, but I began realizing this was a very big deal.TC: How did you get started on your related work?EL: My friend first connected me with Eric Paley of [the venture firm] Founder Collective, and his wife, Shirley, who’s an IP lawyer and so knows this stuff well. Turns out there was a bill in Massachusetts that had been hanging around a while, authored by Anthony Petruccelli, who was a state senator who has since taken a job in the private sector. So we picked it up last year and attached it to an economic development bill, and the response to it was overwhelming.TC: But you didn’t get it through your state’s legislature.EL: We didn’t. So we reached out to the tech and legal community to better understand the ins and outs of what we wanted to propose, and we crafted a new bill — the one that will be heard on Tuesday [by the Joint Committee on Consumer Protection and Professional Licensure].It’s just the second or third inning of this process. The bills — and there are two other patent bills, as well — will be heard on Tuesday. After that, the committee will begin the process of analyzing them and providing recommendations. Then they’re off, potentially, to the floor of both the House and the Senate.TC: When? In the fall? Early next year?EL: It’s hard to tell when that would happen. But everyone is up for reelection in November 2018, so before then, because the whole process starts anew afterward, with a new Senate and House that comes in.TC: Yikes. Is it good news or bad for you that there are two bills dealing with patent trolls?EL: It’s good. It’s a level of the indication of interest and hopefully shows that a lot of members of legislature are involved in this. It also helps create buzz and momentum.I think all of us understand that there is a need to strongly protect intellectual property and show zero tolerance for anyone copying IP. But what we’re seeing is a really vicious and cyclical process where, for profit, people are bullying and scaring young entrepreneurs. You hear about the three or four kids in a dorm room who are tinkering around with an idea, then suddenly, they get slammed with one of these completely vague cease-and-desist letters from a place they’ve never heard of, citing patents they didn’t know existed. The threat is: turn over everything you’re doing to us, or pay us $30,000.TC: Cloudflare is particularly concerned with the growth of non-practicing entities that are started by former IP litigators, because they can buy up unused patents on the cheap, then, using their law degrees, easily and affordably put the screws to companies with those patents. Are you trying to outlaw these firms specifically?EL: It’s a little further afield from where we are today, but not entirely. The way we’ve delineated it is, if you’re involved in R&amp;D or manufacturing or you’re a hospital or a university or a business — basically, if you a real entity — then this bill is likely not going to apply to you.We’re trying with some specificity to zero in on these non-practicing entities, so it would include the [Cloudflare] situation and other patent trolls that we’re observing more and more. These firms raise funding, as would a startup or venture firm, then they use that money to vacuum up a bunch of patents for the sole purpose of suing other companies. That’s bad for the economy, bad for innovation, and frankly, a loophole — a kink — that needs to be resolved.TC: It looks like Anthony Petruccelli was a state senator for nine years. I guess you don’t have term limits in Massachusetts? Do you see yourself staying put for a while?EL: Unlike in California [where you are], we have no term limits here. And yes, I’m [really dedicated to the issue].The tech community hasn’t been engaged in public policy, and for a variety of reasons, you now see the entrepreneurship community and the VC community — especially at the state level — start to really step up and talk about why these protections are important. So we’re really focused on it.There’s inaction on the federal level and complete dysfunction in Congress. Patents and IP have traditionally been the province of the federal government. But for states like California and Massachusetts, this is too important a part of our economy and job creation to wait for the government to get involved.TC: Is there a state that you’ve used in creating your bill, one that you think is getting it right when it comes to patent trolls?EL: There are 33 states with some version of this legislation, so it’s not a brand new idea. It’s been tested in lots of places, with varying degrees of strictness. Given how important startups and venture capital are to Massachusetts, it’s a little embarrassing that we don’t have similar legislation already.0SHARESAdvertisementAdvertisement CrunchbaseCloudflare Founded2009OverviewCloudflare is a web performance and security company that provides online services to protect and accelerate websites online.\\r\\r\\rThe company’s online platforms include Cloudflare CDN, which distributes content around the world to speed up websites; Cloudflare optimizer that enables web pages with ad servers and third-party widgets to download Snappy software on mobiles and computers; CloudFlare …LocationSan Francisco, CACategoriesSecurity, Web Hosting, Advertising, Analytics, Ad Server, Enterprise Software FoundersMichelle ZatlynWebsitehttp://www.cloudflare.com Full profile for Cloudflare Newsletter SubscriptionsThe Daily CrunchGet the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inboxTC Weekly RoundupGet a weekly recap of the biggest tech storiesCrunchbase DailyThe latest startup funding announcementsEnter AddressSubscribeSEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report DraftKings and FanDuel No Longer Merging | Crunch ReportWatch More Episodescloudflarepatent trollsGovernmentPopular Posts Featured Stories Uber acqui-hires social app studio Swipe Labs6 hours ago | Josh Constine Vertu is dead16 hours ago | John Biggs, Steve O'Hear Here’s a sneak peek of what Disney’s Star Wars Land will look like20 hours ago | Greg Kumparak Jefferies gives IBM Watson a Wall Street reality checkyesterday | John MannesLatest From TechCrunch Is Amazon working on a new messaging app called Anytime?48 minutes ago | Ingrid Lunden Microsoft’s Path Guide is an unconventional approach to indoor navigation1 hour ago | Devin Coldewey Scout It Out is a New York marketplace for arts spaces2 hours ago | Jonathan Shieber Light starts shipping the L16, its 16-camera pocket DSLR challenger2 hours ago | Darrell Etherington Comment moderation powered by  Up NextMicrosoft’s Path Guide is an unconventional approach to indoor navigationPosted 1 hour ago  CrunchBoardJob ListingsiOS Developer at Badoo (London, United Kingdom)UI Engineer @ Athos at Athos (Redwood City, CA, United States)Designer at Flocabulary (Brooklyn, NY, United States)Data Engineer at Flocabulary (Brooklyn, NY, United States)Senior Software Engineer at Flocabulary (Brooklyn, NY, United States)More from CrunchBoardAdvertisementTechCrunchNewsVideoEventsCrunchbaseTechCrunch StoreAboutStaffContact UsAdvertise With UsEvent &amp; Editorial CalendarSend Us A TipActivations BlogInternationalChinaEuropeJapanFollow TechCrunchFacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInYoutubePinterestTumblrInstagramStumbleUponFeedTechCrunch AppsiOSAndroidWindows 8Subscribe to The Daily CrunchLatest headlines delivered to you dailySubscribe to &lt;span class=\"no-mobile\"&gt;Subscribe to &lt;/span&gt;The Daily CrunchEnter Email AddressSubscribe © 2013-2017 Oath Inc.

Now that the bill has hit House of Representatives, the bipartisan Energy and Commerce Committee voted to send it along to the full chamber. The Safely Ensuring Lives Future Deployment and Research In Vehicle Evolution Act, or SELF DRIVE, is aimed at allowing companies like Uber and Google to test up to 100,000 autonomous vehicles across the country. While we're far from an actual bill, this seems like good forward movement.If driverless cars are ever going to gain a foothold on the road, they'll need to be as safe as (or safer that) current automobiles are. Companies like Lyft, GM and Toyota have been lobbying for this type of legislation for a while now. The Department of Transportation will need to ensure this if it wants to exempt the vehicles from federal rules that govern current cars, like the requirement they have steering wheels, for example. The proposed bill, which isn't yet scheduled for full House consideration, also bars states from setting their own possibly conflicting regulations around the design, operation and software components of self-driving cars.

Instead of entering a username and password as the only line of defense to our computer systems, it wants us to rely on other data that comes from the phone in our pockets.That smartphone has a number of sensors in it like an accelerometer and a GPS, and using the kinds of data it gather from the phone, the company can begin to build an understanding of who you are, your typical behaviors and even the cadence of how you walk. It pulls this information into a machine learning back-end to process it and build a profile of each individual in the system.The username and password doesn’t go away completely with this technique, but it becomes a secondary form of authentication when the system lacks a high enough probability that it is a given person.You could understand how an approach like that would be attractive to any number of companies and governments, all of which are desperately looking for better ways to secure their systems. It was that same creative thinking that got the company into the TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield in San Francisco last year, where it placed second, and it is the same reasoning that attracts investors.Today, the company announced a $20 million Series A investment led by NEA with participation from Andreessen Horowitz, Stanford-StartX and Accomplice Ventures, each of which had participated in the company’s seed round.When it launched at the Battlefield competition last fall, the company announced a consumer-focused Chrome browser plug-in with an iOS app. Today, it has changed focus, offering a Software Development Kit (SDK) to customers to install their authentication tools as a service inside any application.“The business model is to sell the SDK and backend platform to companies with pre existing mobile apps and charge on a per-API call basis,” co-founder Kurt Somerville told TechCrunch.It’s similar to how a company would add payment services to an application using Stripe or communications services using Twilio.Once the UnifyID tools are in place, a user could simply walk up to their computer, and without signing in, start working because the system would understand based on the UnifyID information that it was that person. In turn, when the person walked away from the machine, it would deactivate it so that nobody else could use the computer.Somerville says the company has done accuracy tests to ensure the validity of the system and claims they have found it to be accurate 99.99 percent of the time.Today, the company is working with 10 business partners on the SDK, and has 15 full time employees, but with $20 million in new money, they are shooting to have around 40 engineers in next 6-9 months. “It’s aggressive scale and we feel we need to do it to be able to work with companies that are showing interest in our platform,” Somerville explained.0SHARESAdvertisementAdvertisement Newsletter SubscriptionsThe Daily CrunchGet the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inboxTC Weekly RoundupGet a weekly recap of the biggest tech storiesCrunchbase DailyThe latest startup funding announcementsEnter AddressSubscribeSEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report Reddit Now Valued at $1.8 Billion | Crunch ReportWatch More EpisodesStartup Battlefieldmulti-factor authenticationauthenticationDeveloperPopular Posts Featured Stories Sling Studio Makes Multi-Camera Video Production So Damn Easy.VIDEO | 5:21 | Gadgets Several departures at venture firm Kleiner Perkins12 hours ago | Katie Roof Spotify preps to go public with 60M subscribers, outpacing Apple17 hours ago | Josh Constine, Katie Roof HBO got hacked and some Game of Thrones materials are bubbling up online18 hours ago | Taylor Hatmaker HomePod firmware reveals iPhone 8 design and facial recognition23 hours ago | Romain DilletLatest From Startups Sofia Vergara wants to empower women with Eby, a new subscription underwear service23 minutes ago | Jordan Crook Boxed is trying to predict when you’ll run out of snacks and toilet paper1 hour ago | Anthony Ha Carspring, a London and Berlin startup that lets you buy a used car online, raises £5M Series B4 hours ago | Steve O'Hear New border wall bill draws on Palmer Luckey’s new defense company10 hours ago | Taylor Hatmaker Comment moderation powered by  Up NextBoxed is trying to predict when you’ll run out of snacks and toilet paperPosted 1 hour ago  CrunchBoardJob ListingsSenior Systems Architect Lead Developers @  Bolt Threads at Bolt Threads (San Francisco, CA, United States)Principal Engineer, Software Operations @ Bolt Threads at Bolt Threads (Emeryville, CA, United States)Software Engineer - Java (Contract) at Motorola Solutions (Seattle, WA, United States)Senior Android and IOS Developer (Contract) at Motorola Solutions (Seattle, WA, United States)Sr Software Engineer (Back End) at Etleap (San Francisco, CA, United States)More from CrunchBoardAdvertisementTechCrunchNewsVideoEventsCrunchbaseTechCrunch StoreAboutStaffContact UsAdvertise With UsEvent &amp; Editorial CalendarSend Us A TipActivations BlogInternationalChinaEuropeJapanFollow TechCrunchFacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInYoutubePinterestTumblrInstagramStumbleUponFeedTechCrunch AppsiOSAndroidWindows 8Subscribe to The Daily CrunchLatest headlines delivered to you dailySubscribe to &lt;span class=\"no-mobile\"&gt;Subscribe to &lt;/span&gt;The Daily CrunchEnter Email AddressSubscribe © 2013-2017 Oath Inc.

Stylish and practical!As Krennic sets his eyes on the young Jyn hiding in the grass, we smash-cut to the present—with Jyn (now played by Felicity Jones) in an Imperial detention facility. It’s cut to make it look like Jyn is waking up from dreaming about her past, but either way, this is definitely from early on in the film.GIF Jyn is busted out of captivity by some Rebels.

Presumably this is not during Jyn’s breakout, as she’s with Cassian this time around.GIF A short shot of Clone Wars veteran Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker)a nd his robot leg is played under Jyn’s simple retort. “We have hope.

As Krennic sets his eyes on the young Jyn hiding in the grass, we smash-cut to the present—with Jyn (now played by Felicity Jones) in an Imperial detention facility. It’s cut to make it look like Jyn is waking up from dreaming about her past, but either way, this is definitely from early on in the film. GIF Jyn is busted out of captivity by some Rebels.

Advertisement“We are going to pray with this baby and we are going to let this baby’s body bear witness to our nation as we begin the process to elect our next president,” the priest continues, inanely listing off various levels of government.Ravone calmly presents the viewer with “a very simple choice.” To either “elect those who are going to affirm the covenant we have with God or those who reject it.” Donald Trump is perhaps closer to God than his opponent considering he presumably grabbed his covenant right by the pussy.“The testimony of scripture and the testimony of the life of this child point to the critical importance of this election,” the priest explains. He urges viewers—of which there were over 250,000—to choose life. In the description of the video, he asserts that voting for Donald Trump and Republicans in general means you’re voting to protect children.SponsoredWill a Facebook Live stream of a priest with a dead baby convince people to vote for Trump? Hard to say. Is Frank’s dead fetus real? Is it even allowed on Facebook? Should it be? In September, the company took down a Pulitzer-winning photograph of a naked Vietnamese girl covered in Napalm. Facebook then reversed its initial decision and reinstated the photo, giving the following statement:After hearing from our community, we looked again at how our Community Standards were applied in this case. An image of a naked child would normally be presumed to violate our Community Standards, and in some countries might even qualify as child pornography. In this case, we recognize the history and global importance of this image in documenting a particular moment in time.We have reached out to Facebook to ask if Pavone’s content is allowed on the platform and will update the post if we get a response.AdvertisementAdvertisementAccording Facebook’s community standards, the company removes “graphic images when they are shared for sadistic pleasure or to celebrate or glorify violence.” So I guess it depends if the priest live streamed this dead fetus for “sadistic pleasure.” One could make a pretty compelling case for that.Here’s the whole (very disturbing) Facebook Live stream:[Washington Post]Eve Peysereve@gizmodo.com@evepeyserEve Peyser is the night editor at Gizmodo.Facebook livEFacebook Admits Pulitzer-Winning Photograph Is Not Child PornographyFacebook Still Says It's Not a Media Company, Announces Election Day CoverageFormer Facebook Workers: We Routinely Suppressed Conservative NewsGear from Kinja DealsUmbra's Twilight Rod Takes Your Curtains from the Windows to the WallBestsellers: HGST Touro S 1TB 7200RPM Portable DriveSave $20 on One of the Only Inkjet Printers You Should Consider BuyingReply24 repliesLeave a replyYou may also likeThe BestsThe Best Strategy Games On PCToday 7:00pmSploidInteractive Periodic Table Reveals Exactly How We Use All Those ElementsToday 10:28amThe ConcourseThe Entire Plot Of The Next Season Of Game Of Thrones Seems To Have LeakedToday 12:15pmRecent from Eve Peyser37Eve Peyser · Eve PeyserElection?

Advertisement“We are going to pray with this baby and we are going to let this baby’s body bear witness to our nation as we begin the process to elect our next president,” the priest continues, inanely listing off various levels of government. Ravone calmly presents the viewer with “a very simple choice. ” To either “elect those who are going to affirm the covenant we have with God or those who reject it. ” Donald Trump is perhaps closer to God than his opponent considering he presumably grabbed his covenant right by the pussy. “The testimony of scripture and the testimony of the life of this child point to the critical importance of this election,” the priest explains. He urges viewers—of which there were over 250,000—to choose life. In the description of the video, he asserts that voting for Donald Trump and Republicans in general means you’re voting to protect a Facebook Live stream of a priest with a dead baby convince people to vote for Trump? Hard to say. Is Frank’s dead fetus real? Is it even allowed on Facebook? Should it be? In September, the company took down a Pulitzer-winning photograph of a naked Vietnamese girl covered in Napalm. Facebook then reversed its initial decision and reinstated the photo, giving the following statement:After hearing from our community, we looked again at how our Community Standards were applied in this case. An image of a naked child would normally be presumed to violate our Community Standards, and in some countries might even qualify as child pornography. In this case, we recognize the history and global importance of this image in documenting a particular moment in time. We have reached out to Facebook to ask if Pavone’s content is allowed on the platform and will update the post if we get a Facebook’s community standards, the company removes “graphic images when they are shared for sadistic pleasure or to celebrate or glorify violence. ” So I guess it depends if the priest live streamed this dead fetus for “sadistic pleasure. ” One could make a pretty compelling case for that.

AMG Chairman Tobias Moers insists the car will become the new hypercar benchmark, with an F1-based 1.6-liter, electrified, turbocharged V6 and four electric motors.The all-wheel drive hypercar won't just deliver levels of performance unparalleled outside the world's racetracks, but will be able to run as a pure battery-electric car for up to 15 miles and, unique for a hypercar, its zero-emission mode will be front-wheel drive. That should make it capable of circumventing limitations on internal-combustion, high-powered cars in some city centers around the world.\"It shifts up the boundaries of what is technically feasible,\" AMG Chairman Tobias Moers said, with production limited to just 275 models. \"We are the first to make pure bred F1 technology roadworthy.\"\"Our objective is not speed, but to be the benchmark. If we have a strategy and we move into a new era of performance at AMG, maybe it's good to have something that opens the door in a very authentic way to that new era and this is it. \"Plug-in hybrid is going to be the future for AMG. We get more performance and more efficiency and what's wrong with that?\" he asked.Technically, though, Ferrari used a Formula One engine as the basis of its F50 supercar back in 1995, though Moers insists the Project One would be a class forward from the least loved of the hypercar Ferraris. \"We are talking about a high-performance hybrid, with one combustion engine and four electric motors. The combustion engine comes from Brixworth, from the same people who delivered three consecutive Formula One World Championships for drivers and manufacturers.\"The redline is at 11,000 and it has a high-tech turbo, which is driven by a 107-horsepower electric motor. Its batteries are the same technology and arrangement as in F1, but we will build four times the storage, with about 25km of pure electric range.\"We have reached thermal efficiency of 43 percent. Nobody else has managed anything like that, street legal.\"By comparison, AMG's 4.0-litre biturbo V8 has a thermal efficiency of around 25 percent.At $2.54 million, the two-seat, hard-top coupe follows Formula One practice by basing the entire car around a carbon-fibre chassis tub, then mounting the engine directly to the tub and mounting the gearbox and differential unit directly to the engine.Both the engine and eight-speed gearbox will be fully stressed parts of the chassis layout, while AMG has chosen to use a computer controlled clutch on a traditional manual gearbox, rather than the dual-clutch transmission layout most supercar makers, including Bugatti, favor.The first deliveries of the car are due late next year, with Moers hoping to finish its production run by the end of 2020, and AMG already has one \"mule\" prototype running to help with initial verification of the powertrain and chassis concept.But the key part of the technology is the Project One's powertrain itself, which AMG insists it pulled directly from its Formula 1 program. Though heavily revised from the W08 EQ Power+ F1 car used by Lewis Hamilton and Valteri Bottas this weekend in Monaco, AMG Chairman Tobias Moers insists the modifications are only basic.\"The idle speed is 1,100 rpm and in F1 it's 3,800 or 4,000. It revs to 11,000 rpm, but in F1 it's 13,500 rpm.\"We have to move combustion ratio, for example, that's what changes. In F1 they run Lambda that's way more than one. But we can't because of emissions. We have the same cylinder head, same crank housing but a different crankshaft.\"For all that, though, Moers insists customers won't need the usual array of Formula One race engineers and laptop computers to start the engine.\"Prospective buyers have been asking if they will require a support crew or dedicated lubricants to run it. My answer is always 'no.' It will be a street car. You keep it plugged in in the garage. You fill it with 98 (Ron fuel).\"The trickier parts of the powertrain will be the way it combines its electrified and internal-combustion power. A ground-breaking engine in Formula One, the AMG V6 splits its single, large turbocharger, with the exhaust turbine moved to the back of the engine with the exhaust system and the compressor wheel sitting at the front of the engine where the cooler air is. A shaft runs through the engine's vee angle to join them together.Firstly, there is the power and torque from the tiny 1.6-liter V6 (which AMG wouldn't talk about, but which must be somewhere around 470 hp). Then it also has a 134-hp electric motor (the MGU-K for \"kinetic\" in AMG-speak) directly attached to the engine's crankshaft and another 107-hp (the MGU-H for \"heat\") electric motor that spins up the turbocharger to eliminate turbo lag.\"The 80kW from the MGU-H is not so important to rev it (the turbocharger compressor) up but it's important for regeneration,\" Moers insisted. \"It could be a lot smaller to rev and still spin it up.\"Any excess energy the MGU-H harvests can be sent directly to the MGU-K to punch more electric torque directly through the crankshaft.Then there a 161-horsepower electric motor for each front wheel, which use essentially the same construction and design as the MGU-K, but in different housings.While Moers would not be drawn on the car's target weight, he did confirm that the entire powertrain would weight about 926 pounds, with the battery pack accounting for 220 lbs of that. The battery, built by its F1 supplier ABC, runs the same chemistry, cells and connectors as Hamilton's racer, but is four times larger to add in the Project One's zero-emission capability.What makes the Project One particularly complicated is that all of its electric motors act as both motors and generators to recharge the fast-discharge battery, which has a converter to turn 800 volts into 12 volts sitting on top of its housing.The extreme forces acting inside the highly stressed 1.6-liter V6 mean AMG will only rate it for 31,000 miles before it needs to be \"remanufactured\".\"We have an understanding of about 50,000 km. This is OK for us. I think that's good enough,\" Mr. Moers insisted.\"That's the life of the engine. Then we do some rework, like in a race car.\"After 31,000 miles, the engines would either be rebuilt by AMG or, depending on the work needed, replaced, and AMG didn't rule out customers choosing to buy the car with a spare engine ready to go. As an aside, it has yet to put a price tag on either a new engine or a rebuild.This year's Formula One rules dictate that each driver can only use four hybrid power units for the entire 20-race season, though that drops to three of the V6 internal-combustion engines next year. While that's just over 3,728 miles of Grand Prix racing, the engines and electrified power units could easily double that with four hours of practice and a one-hour qualifying shootout each race weekend.The supercar industry's widespread reaction to Moers' claims of using a Formula One motor has been disbelief.Ferrari basically said it doesn't believe Mercedes-AMG. Ferrari, the only other race-winning Formula One engine supplier this year, clearly doubts whether AMG's hypercar was a) using an F1-sourced engine and b) whether that was a good idea in the first place.In an interview back at the Geneva Motor Show, Ferrari's road-car chief engineer, Michael Leiters, said there was no way Ferrari would follow suit.\"Putting an F1 engine into a road car? We already did it with the F50 and I'm not convinced it works. An F1 engine runs at 16,000 rpm. How can you use a car that revs to 16,000 rpm on the street? You can't, and if it doesn't rev to 16,000 rpm, you have to ask the question, what remains of the Formula 1 engine?\"Instead of actual F1 engine, I'm convinced it's better to take some concepts and innovations from a Formula 1 car. To make a supercar, I prefer to do it from scratch,\" he insisted.The all-wheel-drive Project One hypercar has fine torque vectoring at both ends, and eliminates the packaging difficulties of anti-roll bars via five-link suspension systems at both ends.AMG has separated the vertical bump and roll tasks in the suspension with two springs in series sharing a single damper, while the longest rear pushrod in the car world is mounted directly to the upright and in large part defines the car's aerodynamic package.It will use a variable ride height and a variable aerodynamic package, to get the best from its custom-developed Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 285/35 19 front and 335/30 20 tires, which ride on center-lock wheels.The transmission, too, will be similar to the Formula One car's eight-speed unit, strengthened for longevity, and using the electric motors to \"fill in\" any acceleration holes during gear changes.Moers insists the car will have different driving modes, ranging from the zero-emission front-drive BEV mode to a mode so aggressive it will be similar to a Grand Prix qualifying setup.

The combustion engine comes from Brixworth, from the same people who delivered three consecutive Formula One World Championships for drivers and manufacturers. \"The redline is at 11,000 and it has a high-tech turbo, which is driven by a 107-horsepower electric motor. Its batteries are the same technology and arrangement as in F1, but we will build four times the storage, with about 25km of pure electric range. \"We have reached thermal efficiency of 43 percent. Nobody else has managed anything like that, street legal. \"By comparison, AMG's 4. 0-litre biturbo V8 has a thermal efficiency of around 25 percent. At $2. 54 million, the two-seat, hard-top coupe follows Formula One practice by basing the entire car around a carbon-fibre chassis tub, then mounting the engine directly to the tub and mounting the gearbox and differential unit directly to the engine. Both the engine and eight-speed gearbox will be fully stressed parts of the chassis layout, while AMG has chosen to use a computer controlled clutch on a traditional manual gearbox, rather than the dual-clutch transmission layout most supercar makers, including Bugatti, favor. The first deliveries of the car are due late next year, with Moers hoping to finish its production run by the end of 2020, and AMG already has one \"mule\" prototype running to help with initial verification of the powertrain and chassis concept. But the key part of the technology is the Project One's powertrain itself, which AMG insists it pulled directly from its Formula 1 program. Though heavily revised from the W08 EQ Power+ F1 car used by Lewis Hamilton and Valteri Bottas this weekend in Monaco, AMG Chairman Tobias Moers insists the modifications are only basic. \"The idle speed is 1,100 rpm and in F1 it's 3,800 or 4,000. It revs to 11,000 rpm, but in F1 it's 13,500 rpm. \"We have to move combustion ratio, for example, that's what changes. In F1 they run Lambda that's way more than one. But we can't because of emissions. We have the same cylinder head, same crank housing but a different crankshaft. \"For all that, though, Moers insists customers won't need the usual array of Formula One race engineers and laptop computers to start the engine. \"Prospective buyers have been asking if they will require a support crew or dedicated lubricants to run it. My answer is always 'no. ' It will be a street car. You keep it plugged in in the garage. You fill it with 98 (Ron fuel). \"The trickier parts of the powertrain will be the way it combines its electrified and internal-combustion power. A ground-breaking engine in Formula One, the AMG V6 splits its single, large turbocharger, with the exhaust turbine moved to the back of the engine with the exhaust system and the compressor wheel sitting at the front of the engine where the cooler air is. A shaft runs through the engine's vee angle to join them together. Firstly, there is the power and torque from the tiny 1. 6-liter V6 (which AMG wouldn't talk about, but which must be somewhere around 470 hp). Then it also has a 134-hp electric motor (the MGU-K for \"kinetic\" in AMG-speak) directly attached to the engine's crankshaft and another 107-hp (the MGU-H for \"heat\") electric motor that spins up the turbocharger to eliminate turbo lag. \"The 80kW from the MGU-H is not so important to rev it (the turbocharger compressor) up but it's important for regeneration,\" Moers insisted. \"It could be a lot smaller to rev and still spin it up. \"Any excess energy the MGU-H harvests can be sent directly to the MGU-K to punch more electric torque directly through the crankshaft. Then there a 161-horsepower electric motor for each front wheel, which use essentially the same construction and design as the MGU-K, but in different housings. While Moers would not be drawn on the car's target weight, he did confirm that the entire powertrain would weight about 926 pounds, with the battery pack accounting for 220 lbs of that. The battery, built by its F1 supplier ABC, runs the same chemistry, cells and connectors as Hamilton's racer, but is four times larger to add in the Project One's zero-emission capability. What makes the Project One particularly complicated is that all of its electric motors act as both motors and generators to recharge the fast-discharge battery, which has a converter to turn 800 volts into 12 volts sitting on top of its housing. The extreme forces acting inside the highly stressed 1. 6-liter V6 mean AMG will only rate it for 31,000 miles before it needs to be \"remanufactured\". \"We have an understanding of about 50,000 km. This is OK for us. I think that's good enough,\" Mr. Moers insisted. \"That's the life of the engine. Then we do some rework, like in a race car. \"After 31,000 miles, the engines would either be rebuilt by AMG or, depending on the work needed, replaced, and AMG didn't rule out customers choosing to buy the car with a spare engine ready to go. As an aside, it has yet to put a price tag on either a new engine or a rebuild. This year's Formula One rules dictate that each driver can only use four hybrid power units for the entire 20-race season, though that drops to three of the V6 internal-combustion engines next year. While that's just over 3,728 miles of Grand Prix racing, the engines and electrified power units could easily double that with four hours of practice and a one-hour qualifying shootout each race weekend. The supercar industry's widespread reaction to Moers' claims of using a Formula One motor has been disbelief. Ferrari basically said it doesn't believe Mercedes-AMG. Ferrari, the only other race-winning Formula One engine supplier this year, clearly doubts whether AMG's hypercar was a) using an F1-sourced engine and b) whether that was a good idea in the first place. In an interview back at the Geneva Motor Show, Ferrari's road-car chief engineer, Michael Leiters, said there was no way Ferrari would follow suit. \"Putting an F1 engine into a road car? We already did it with the F50 and I'm not convinced it works. An F1 engine runs at 16,000 rpm. How can you use a car that revs to 16,000 rpm on the street? You can't, and if it doesn't rev to 16,000 rpm, you have to ask the question, what remains of the Formula 1 engine? \"Instead of actual F1 engine, I'm convinced it's better to take some concepts and innovations from a Formula 1 car. To make a supercar, I prefer to do it from scratch,\" he insisted. The all-wheel-drive Project One hypercar has fine torque vectoring at both ends, and eliminates the packaging difficulties of anti-roll bars via five-link suspension systems at both ends. AMG has separated the vertical bump and roll tasks in the suspension with two springs in series sharing a single damper, while the longest rear pushrod in the car world is mounted directly to the upright and in large part defines the car's aerodynamic package. It will use a variable ride height and a variable aerodynamic package, to get the best from its custom-developed Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 285/35 19 front and 335/30 20 tires, which ride on center-lock wheels. The transmission, too, will be similar to the Formula One car's eight-speed unit, strengthened for longevity, and using the electric motors to \"fill in\" any acceleration holes during gear changes. Moers insists the car will have different driving modes, ranging from the zero-emission front-drive BEV mode to a mode so aggressive it will be similar to a Grand Prix qualifying setup.

More posts by this contributor:UPDATED: Attack of the dronesThe Age of Resilience – Security in 2017As Content Delivery Networks (CDN) market leaders like Akamai and CloudFlare grapple with technological shifts, some innovators like Teridion, Signal Sciences and Section.io (in which I am an investor) are making rapid advances. The CDN market, estimated at $5bn today, is anticipated to be over $10bn by 2019. While the market is growing rapidly, can the giants learn to dance? How are the startup aiming slingshots at the legacy Goliaths? Newcomers like Stackpath aim to win by offering a “security first” CDN, which in the wake of the #CloudBleed can be a marketing differentiator. Above all, how will that elephant in the room – Amazon Cloudfront – trample all the unicorns?Looking back: A brief history of CDNsThe first wave of CDNs started with Akamai almost two decades ago in 1998. CDNs were designed to accelerate web content. In the world of constrained bandwidth, speed of delivery is affected by a variety of factors including page content and effective routing of traffic. Web companies that experience heavy web traffic needed a reliable, rapid mechanism to ensure uninterrupted service. Akamai promised all that, and then some.Within a year of its launch, Akamai went IPO and had Apple Computer as its logo customer. At the time, Apple constituted 45% of its total $1.2m revenues. Limelight Networks was a fast-follower to Akamai and was launched in 2001. It went public in 2007 but has not been able to catch up with Akamai. In 2016, Akamai posted $2.3bn in revenues with a market cap of over $10 billion. (Limelight Networks posted $170 million revenues in 2016 with a market cap of $290 million. Private Equity shops, take note.)Over time, websites became more dynamic and bloated, and we entered the SaaS /application era. And then, the shifts of cloud and mobility changed the way content was delivered and consumed. CDNs started to mitigate DDOS attacks. Add the growing demand for security to that mix and slowly but surely, the CDN universe is getting disrupted.Amazon launched its own CDN – Cloudfront in 2008. Cloudflare started circa 2009 offering content delivery, security and analytics. In 2011, Fastly got launched and recently announced a new $50m funding round. Stackpath raised $180m in a single round to disrupt CDN markets.  It’s CEO, Lance Crosby is a badass who started SoftLayer sold it to IBM for $2 bn. Having that kind of an exit made it easier for Lance to raise a war chest of $180m.CompanyYear StartedCapital RaisedInvestorsCloudflareJuly 2009$182 mNEA, Union Square Ventures, FidelityFastlyMarch 2011$179 mBattery Ventures, August Capital, Iconiq, Sapphire VenturesStackpath2015$180mABRY PartnersThese newcomers have created headaches for Akamai, eating into its margins steadily forcing the price down. Akamai’s Media Delivery Solutions revenue for 2016 was down 9% year-over-year. As CDNs supply-demand curve shifts, customers are enjoying price drops of 20% to 40%.Grappling with changesAs we enter the new applications / devops driven world, the developers will drive the nextgen CDN consumption. Dynamic microservices, Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) and of course, performance and security remains paramount.Let us look at some of the technological shifts:Bloated web pages: We are fat, getting fatter: Average bytes per web page has grown ~3X to 2.4 MB in the past five years, as reported by httparchive.orgAn Akamai study shows, web page load times for desktops have increased by 63.8% in two years, from 7.2 seconds (2013) to 11.8 seconds (2015). And when it comes to dynamic content, customized to enhance the user experience, all bets are off. Steven Sinofsky, the former President of Windows division of Microsoft tweeted recently about LinkedIn slow load time as his ‘favorite new feature’.The growth of video: As the CDNs attempt to deliver bloated pages, the type of content has shifted. The demand for video / live streaming / dynamic application content continues to grow. Video is expected to grow 4X by 2020 when Cisco predicts 82% of all IP traffic will be video. Video consumption during busy-hour Internet traffic (7pm-11pm) is expected to grow nearly 5-fold from 2015 to 2020. Dynamic content and bandwidth peaks is the new CDN game, away from static cached content.Mobile consumption increases: By 2020, ~30% of traffic is expected to come from smartphones. The average load time for mobile sites is much more worse – 19 seconds over 3G connections. In a September 2016 “The Need for Mobile Speed” study, Google found that 53% of mobile site visits are abandoned if pages take longer than 3 seconds to load. The data, based on analysis of more than 10,000 mobile Web domains suggested that mobile sites load in 5 seconds earn up to 2 times more mobile ad revenue than those whose sites load in 19 seconds.So publishers are motivated to drive for speed. And we all know that one second delay in Amazon’s web page load time could burn $1.6bn in sales. Accelerating content for mobile is a headache for CDNs.Not too far away in the future are gaming, VR/AR and IoT companies. The times they are a changing – and getting messier. Such technological changes are forcing CDNs to improve speed, while dealing with dynamic content.Optimizing traffic routes over diverse network pathways (ISP, 3G, mobile), balancing load / peak demand and ensuring security is now expected of CDNs. While legacy CDNs are slow to react, several upstarts are tackling traffic optimization, nextgen WAF and DevOps friendly CDNs.Optimization of routing:The routing of internet traffic is determined by an archaic Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which does not factor in timing for data routing. It only looks at the number of hops between two networks. But what if the route with least number of hops may be congested? Or the protocol picks a physically longer route?For example, a packet may traverse from San Francisco to Los Angeles via Brazil. What if there was a route with multiple hops but was much more faster? BGP works really well in terms of reliability. It is a fundamental technology on which the Internet is built, but BGP is sub-optimal from a latency (delays, jitter, and image freezing) standpoint.Teridion acts like the ‘waze of internet traffic’ and optimizes traffic routes using third party cloud. Its platform helps make real time packet routing decisions to avoid congested paths. Unlike CDNs, its solution scales on-demand and is not limited by upstream communication, pre-provisioned PoPs, geography or cloud providers. It is therefore much quicker to provision. As there is no caching of data, SSL certificate management, security and compliance issues are non-existent. It extends to each and every end-user of a cloud-delivered service.Chris Keene, chief executive of Teridion says, “As you add more options for acceleration, each has its own security implications and possible tradeoffs. Some companies do not want to share SSL Certificates and give up the keys to their kingdom. CDNs cannot do much for such companies.”Egnyte, an Enterprise File Sync and Sharing (EFSS) upstart beat some of the giants of file share companies such as Box, Citrix, Google and Microsoft. It was faster by 30% in speed over Box and as much as 60% for larger 4GB files.Egnyte was ranked one of the top vendors achieving high marks in a IDC study of sync performance of file share and storage vendors.  Kris Lahiri.

More posts by this contributor:UPDATED: Attack of the dronesThe Age of Resilience – Security in 2017As Content Delivery Networks (CDN) market leaders like Akamai and CloudFlare grapple with technological shifts, some innovators like Teridion, Signal Sciences and Section. io (in which I am an investor) are making rapid advances. The CDN market, estimated at $5bn today, is anticipated to be over $10bn by 2019. While the market is growing rapidly, can the giants learn to dance? How are the startup aiming slingshots at the legacy Goliaths? Newcomers like Stackpath aim to win by offering a “security first” CDN, which in the wake of the #CloudBleed can be a marketing differentiator. Above all, how will that elephant in the room – Amazon Cloudfront – trample all the unicorns? Looking back: A brief history of CDNsThe first wave of CDNs started with Akamai almost two decades ago in 1998. CDNs were designed to accelerate web content. In the world of constrained bandwidth, speed of delivery is affected by a variety of factors including page content and effective routing of traffic. Web companies that experience heavy web traffic needed a reliable, rapid mechanism to ensure uninterrupted service. Akamai promised all that, and then some. Within a year of its launch, Akamai went IPO and had Apple Computer as its logo customer. At the time, Apple constituted 45% of its total $1. 2m revenues. Limelight Networks was a fast-follower to Akamai and was launched in 2001. It went public in 2007 but has not been able to catch up with Akamai. In 2016, Akamai posted $2. 3bn in revenues with a market cap of over $10 billion. (Limelight Networks posted $170 million revenues in 2016 with a market cap of $290 million. Private Equity shops, take note. )Over time, websites became more dynamic and bloated, and we entered the SaaS /application era. And then, the shifts of cloud and mobility changed the way content was delivered and consumed. CDNs started to mitigate DDOS attacks. Add the growing demand for security to that mix and slowly but surely, the CDN universe is getting disrupted. Amazon launched its own CDN – Cloudfront in 2008. Cloudflare started circa 2009 offering content delivery, security and analytics. In 2011, Fastly got launched and recently announced a new $50m funding round. Stackpath raised $180m in a single round to disrupt CDN markets. It’s CEO, Lance Crosby is a badass who started SoftLayer sold it to IBM for $2 bn. Having that kind of an exit made it easier for Lance to raise a war chest of $180m. CompanyYear StartedCapital 2009$182 mNEA, Union Square Ventures, FidelityFastlyMarch 2011$179 mBattery Ventures, August Capital, Iconiq, Sapphire PartnersThese newcomers have created headaches for Akamai, eating into its margins steadily forcing the price down. Akamai’s Media Delivery Solutions revenue for 2016 was down 9% year-over-year. As CDNs supply-demand curve shifts, customers are enjoying price drops of 20% to 40%. Grappling with changesAs we enter the new applications / devops driven world, the developers will drive the nextgen CDN consumption. Dynamic microservices, Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) and of course, performance and security remains paramount. Let us look at some of the technological shifts:Bloated web pages: We are fat, getting fatter: Average bytes per web page has grown ~3X to 2. 4 MB in the past five years, as reported by Akamai study shows, web page load times for desktops have increased by 63. 8% in two years, from 7. 2 seconds (2013) to 11. 8 seconds (2015). And when it comes to dynamic content, customized to enhance the user experience, all bets are off. Steven Sinofsky, the former President of Windows division of Microsoft tweeted recently about LinkedIn slow load time as his ‘favorite new feature’. The growth of video: As the CDNs attempt to deliver bloated pages, the type of content has shifted. The demand for video / live streaming / dynamic application content continues to grow. Video is expected to grow 4X by 2020 when Cisco predicts 82% of all IP traffic will be video. Video consumption during busy-hour Internet traffic (7pm-11pm) is expected to grow nearly 5-fold from 2015 to 2020. Dynamic content and bandwidth peaks is the new CDN game, away from static cached content. Mobile consumption increases: By 2020, ~30% of traffic is expected to come from smartphones. The average load time for mobile sites is much more worse – 19 seconds over 3G connections. In a September 2016 “The Need for Mobile Speed” study, Google found that 53% of mobile site visits are abandoned if pages take longer than 3 seconds to load. The data, based on analysis of more than 10,000 mobile Web domains suggested that mobile sites load in 5 seconds earn up to 2 times more mobile ad revenue than those whose sites load in 19 seconds. So publishers are motivated to drive for speed. And we all know that one second delay in Amazon’s web page load time could burn $1. 6bn in sales. Accelerating content for mobile is a headache for CDNs. Not too far away in the future are gaming, VR/AR and IoT companies. The times they are a changing – and getting messier. Such technological changes are forcing CDNs to improve speed, while dealing with dynamic content. Optimizing traffic routes over diverse network pathways (ISP, 3G, mobile), balancing load / peak demand and ensuring security is now expected of CDNs. While legacy CDNs are slow to react, several upstarts are tackling traffic optimization, nextgen WAF and DevOps friendly CDNs. Optimization of routing:The routing of internet traffic is determined by an archaic Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which does not factor in timing for data routing. It only looks at the number of hops between two networks. But what if the route with least number of hops may be congested? Or the protocol picks a physically longer route? For example, a packet may traverse from San Francisco to Los Angeles via Brazil. What if there was a route with multiple hops but was much more faster? BGP works really well in terms of reliability. It is a fundamental technology on which the Internet is built, but BGP is sub-optimal from a latency (delays, jitter, and image freezing) standpoint. Teridion acts like the ‘waze of internet traffic’ and optimizes traffic routes using third party cloud. Its platform helps make real time packet routing decisions to avoid congested paths. Unlike CDNs, its solution scales on-demand and is not limited by upstream communication, pre-provisioned PoPs, geography or cloud providers. It is therefore much quicker to provision. As there is no caching of data, SSL certificate management, security and compliance issues are non-existent. It extends to each and every end-user of a cloud-delivered service. Chris Keene, chief executive of Teridion says, “As you add more options for acceleration, each has its own security implications and possible tradeoffs. Some companies do not want to share SSL Certificates and give up the keys to their kingdom. CDNs cannot do much for such companies. ”Egnyte, an Enterprise File Sync and Sharing (EFSS) upstart beat some of the giants of file share companies such as Box, Citrix, Google and Microsoft. It was faster by 30% in speed over Box and as much as 60% for larger 4GB files. Egnyte was ranked one of the top vendors achieving high marks in a IDC study of sync performance of file share and storage vendors. Kris Lahiri. Cofounder of Egnyte says, “The IDC speed test looked at the time to “synchronize” content between the local client and the cloud. This is bidirectional, so any changes made on endpoints needed to be synchronized ASAP. We used a robust web socket connection, smart clients and Teridion’s network acceleration. All these different optimizations got reflected in the results observed by IDC. ”Instead of the conventional CDN path, Egnyte created its own PoPs and partnered with Teridion to optimize the route dynamically in a continuously optimized fashion.

Content + security = Better CDNCDNs moved into security by offering DDoS protection. A site could be taken down with a flood of requests.

Behold, Spoilers!DeadpoolSpeaking to The Playlist, writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick are surprisingly and refreshingly optimistic about Ryan Reynold’s aims to get Hugh Jackman to star in a Deadpool/Wolverine crossover film. Here’s Wernick:Advertisement We’ve come a long way from 2009, when we couldn’t get the movie off the ground ’til now. And to have [this team-up]? It would be amazing to have Hugh resurrect Wolverine in the Deadpool universe, and again, Ryan’s making a hard push to make that happen, and hopefully the public gets behind it and we can all convince Hugh to put the claws on one more time.But if one did go through, according to Reese, it’d require a pretty big shuffling of the plans the pair currently have for the Deadpool movie universe:Advertisement Yeah, [a crossover] would, if you think about it. If you’re looking at Deadpool 2, if you’re looking at X-Force, if you’re looking at Deadpool 3, there’s not necessarily room for [another] team-up movie. I think it does create real scheduling and universe issues and something that could be ironed out, but it would need to be ironed out. I don’t think any of us operated under the assumption that it would be even possible to do a Deadpool/Wolverine thing, so we just haven’t planned for it, it’s still not in the plan, but if it were to happen, it would require a hard look at the overall architecture of our storylines.LoganDirector James Mangold explains why Patrick Stewart’s elderly Charles Xavier has some hair in the movie:[It] could be kind of sacrilege. The theory was that he originally lost all his hair because it’s just too damn busy [in his head] to grow hair – the idea for me was, well, maybe there’s a little fringe on there, because things are slowing down mentally. [Empire]Black PantherAccording to Variety, production is headed to South Korea to film a huge chase scene between Black Panther and the film’s primary villain, featuring 150 cars, 700 people, and even a few helicopters to boot. Oh, and loads of gunfire, obviously.Thor: RagnarokDirector Taika Waititi compares the scale of the movie to something like Civil War:AdvertisementSponsored Sometimes I would stop and think, I’m doing a movie that’s got Thor and Doctor Strange and The Incredible Hulk and Loki and every character is so strange and different. Civil War it’s just humans, humans with human problems. Ours is creatures and beings and all these sorts of really different characters. Again displaying human problems, but in outer space or in other worlds.He also confirms that he’s going to make a cameo appearance in the movie, but didn’t disclose the role:AdvertisementIt’s not like a thing that I’ve ever planned, but now I’m in all of my movies in a small role or a larger role. I’ll probably just keep doing that. It’s like a dumb thing I do now.[AV Club]SuspiriaFilming on the remake of the horror classic has now wrapped. [Deadline]Robin Hood: OriginsVisually, the film will be heavily inspired by John Wick, according to producer Basil Iwanyk:AdvertisementAdvertisementThe images of Robin Hood, the imagery we have, the production design, the stunt work that we’re doing—a lot of it was inspired by the John Wick stunt work. The stuff we’re doing with the bow and arrow, it’s the same thing that Keanu does with the gun. The costumes, it just feels different than any other Robin Hood we had.Iwanyk goes on to describe the film’s gritty, PTSD-driven angle on the Robin Hood legend.Exempting the killer cast, I feel that it captures the adventure and the fun and the spirit of Robin Hood, but because it’s the origin story—it’s a kid going off to war thinking he’s going on a great Crusade, and realizing it’s all bullshit and coming back with some PTSD and realizing he’s been lied to, and coming back to kind of a fractured society that doesn’t really accept him and realizing, ‘Okay the super rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting poorer.’ You could describe that now.

I can’t really speak to that. I come in and out of it, sort of, but I’ve been involved in it for about 20 years — I signed the deal in ’96! I think there’ll just be crossover and standalone.

You can also expect “a new kind of Ice Warrior” according to the Gatiss, who also wrote the Ice Warriors’ earlier return in season eight’s “Cold Blood.” That was a great episode, so we’re looking forward to this.Shannara ChroniclesA lengthy plot synopsis for the second season has been released:Season two picks up a year following the events of the finale and focuses on a reemergence of magic that terrifies the citizens of Arbolorn, thanks to a shadowy organization called The Crimson charged with hunting down anyone practicing sorcery and sewing discord among the citizenry of The Four Lands. Meanwhile, a still mourning Wil is forced to abandon his plans to become a healer and rejoin the fight when he’s saved from a Crimson attack; fortunately, he’s soon reunited with Eretria and the two venture off the find Allanon. Only they’re confronted with Bandon’s journey to the dark side, which includes a mission to resurrect an evil known as The Warlock Lord.Joining the cast of The Shannara Chronicles for season two are Malese Jow (Star-Crossed) as Mareth, the unpredictable, independent young woman who rescues Wil from the Crimson and forms an instant connection with the half-elf; Vanessa Morgan (Finding Carter) as Lyria, a mysterious young woman romantically linked to Eretria; Desmond Chiam (NCIS) as General Rigam, a former top dog under Evertine whose fingerprints are all over the chaos in The Four Lands; Gentry White (UnREAL) as charismatic bounty hunter Garet, known throughout the Four Lands as The Weapons Master; and Caroline Chikezie (Everly) as Queen Tamlin, the ruler of the only human kingdom in The Four Lands.Agents of SHIELDEpisode 15 of the current season is titled “Self Control.” Ominous, given that the back half of the season is all about Life Model Decoys.

The city is booming, and the blistering pace at which Upfront was able to close the fund (from launch to close within two-and-a-half months, according to managing partner, Mark Suster), is just another sign that the technology scene in Los Angeles is ascendant.Indeed, at the firm’s  Upfront Summit, an invite only affair for investors, entrepreneurs, tastemakers and celebrities held earlier this year, Suster managed to wrangle celebrity entrepreneurs and investors like Kobe Bryant, Baron Davis, Tyra Banks, and Gwyneth Paltrow (and the mayor) to pitch the wonders of Los Angeles to the investment community.The $400 million oversubscribed fund is the largest ever raised in the city, Suster said, noting that the close brings the firms total assets under management to $2 billion.“LA has truly arrived,” Suster tells me. “In the past people were reluctant to see a really big VC in LA.Roughly 45% of the capital from the new fund will likely d be deployed in Los Angeles and Suthern California, Suster said. Indeed, a number of early stage and Series A-focused investment vehicles will likely feed into the already bulging ecosystem of strong startup companies.Suster declined to comment on the performance of the firm’s latest fund, but did say that its second fund was the best performing fund of its vintage, with investments in BillMeLater, Overture, and Investnet.Now with big bets on Ring, Loot Crate, GOAT, and TrueCar, there’s been a shift toward more consumer-focused offerings that can leverage what Tyra Banks has called Los Angeles'”silicon reach”.What limited partners were drawn to, in the funds ‘ latest closing was its track record. “What they saw was differentiation and performance,” said Suster. “A fund formed in Silicon Valley is competing for deal with every other manager.”While the size of the fund has expanded Upfront has also expanded its team, meaning the focus of the firm’s investments will remain on seed and Series A round investors. “Almost 90% of the deals are sed capital and Series,” Suster said.Five years ago the firm had four partners, and now the firm employs six partners — including new addition Kobie Fuller, who came to Upfront from Accel in the past year.Now the firm’s investment partners include founder  Yves Sisteron, Greg Bettinelli, Kara Nortman, Fuller, Suster, and Kevin Zhang. Stuart Lander is the firm’s partner in charge of operations and platform teams for the firm.Upfront Ventures managing partner Mark Suster and founder Yves SisteronFor Suster, Upfront’s success is a function of a broader trend toward the geographical dispersion of successful investment funds throughout the U.S.Pointing to Bijan Sabet’s Spark Capital in Boston, to Fred Wilson’s Union Square Ventures in New York, and Philadelphia’s First Round Capital helmed by Josh Kopelman, Suster noted that the diversification of venture is more than just a consequence of geography.In a city like Los Angeles, which graduates more engineers than any other American urban center, and which has a broad, diverse background, gender and racial diversity are just as important to a firm’s success as the capital it raises.Suster underscored the importance of this in his own blog post about the fund’s close, writing:Upfront has long held the view that with regards to equality we should DO more than SAY but the events of the last weeks have led us to want to verbalize more our deep-seated commitment to equality in funding founders across ethnicities, nationalities and genders. We believe this isn’t just a market statement — it is where we will drive huge and differentiated returns.Dating back to Upfront II in 2000 (the single best performing fund in the US for that vintage) 2 of our 3 best returns were driven by companies with female founders / CEOs.More recently reports have come out listing VC firms ranked by percentage of female founders where we’re usually listed in the top 5% nationally.In our most recent fund ~30% of the companies we’ve backed have had at least one of the primary founders as a woman.As the firm looks ahead to its own future, Suster and the firm he’s helped grow remain committed to the future of Los Angeles. The two are paired and these days if an investor is #LongLA (to use the hashtag the firm coined), it looks like limited partners are saying that it pays to be long on Upfront as well.0SHARESAdvertisementAdvertisement CrunchbaseMark Suster BioMark Suster is a Partner at Upfront Ventures.

Violet Blue, @violetblue       29m ago              in SecurityComments 151SharesShareTweetShareSaveIllustration by D. Thomas MageeRepresentative Tom Graves (R-GA) thinks that when anyone gets hacked -- individuals or companies -- they should be able to \"fight back\" and go \"hunt for hackers outside of their own networks.\" The Active Cyber Defense Certainty (\"ACDC\") Act is getting closer to being put before lawmakers, and the Congressman trying to make \"hacking back\" easy-breezy-legal believes it would've stopped the WannaCry ransomware.Despite its endlessly lulzy acronym, Graves says he \"looks forward to formally introducing ACDC\" to the U.S. House of Representatives in the next few weeks.Hacking back sounds really awesome at first glance, and obviously, especially to lawmakers. The hacking back of \"ACDC\" in action would most likely happen just like on Mr. Robot, or in that movie about black hats. Evil hackers invade a company's computer system and plant a cyber-bomb. Except the company's IT department is actually a crack team of formerly-evil hackers who now work for the good guys (you can tell they're the good guys because they have jobs). Because it's now legal, the good guys dive into The Matrix and defuse the cyber-bomb just in time! Then they fly through the wires to get into the bad guy's computer, instantly downloading his name and address and Tinder profile, sending it instantly to the FBI who bust through the guy's door right as he's trying to wipe the files!Yeah, that's probably how lawmakers see it happening, too.Attacks that go both waysThe bipartisan ACDC bill would let companies who believe they are under ongoing attack break into the computer of whomever they think is attacking them, for the purposes of stopping the attack or gathering info for law enforcement. According to early press, the bill \"includes caveats such as you cannot destroy data on another person's computer, cause physical injury to someone or create a threat to public safety.This is Rep Graves's second attempt at making ACDC work out with all his friends. His May 25th revision of the legislation included attempts at limiting collateral damage, which as you may have suspected, is a particular criticism of people who work in infosec.According to Politico, who had the early scoop on the new version:Key changes include: a mandatory reporting requirement for entities that use active-defense technique to help federal law enforcement ensure such tools are used responsibly; a two-year sunset clause that would make Congress revisit the law in order to make changes; and an exemption allowing people or companies to recover their lost data if it's found using defensive techniques and can be grabbed back without destroying other data.Setting aside the naive idea that digital secrets can somehow be \"stolen back,\" just that information alone diagrams why hacking back generally isn't considered a great idea by most.Brian Bartholomew, senior security researcher at Kaspersky Lab, told Engadget, \"While the proposal's intent is to make it more difficult for an attack to be successful, it also raises major concern within the community.\" He explained that for starters, it's impossible to contain what data the victim touches when they're hacking back, destroying the bill's rule that victims only mess with their own stolen property.\"Another concern is for chain of custody preservation,\" Bartholomew told Engadget, even if victims tell law enforcement what they're about to do. \"Providing a 'plan of action' is a far cry from possessing the proper training or legal expertise on how to preserve evidence that will be upheld in a court of law,\" he explained. \"It is only a matter of time until the first criminal is prosecuted and evidence [is] thrown out due to improper chain of custody or documentation.\"Attribution is hard and usually wrong when not done by teams of professional analysts. And even then they get it wrong thanks to the incredible skills attackers have at what's called \"false flagging\" -- making attacks look like they're from someone else.Bartholomew, who co-authored the leading research on \"false flag operations\" agreed:\"As it has been demonstrated many times before, attackers are becoming more and more aware of techniques to throw defenders off their scent and lead them down a wrong path.\"\"Pointing the proverbial finger at another attacker is becoming more commonplace and with the introduction of this bill, the possible outcome of such an act can potentially be devastating. Performing proper attribution of an attack is an already difficult and sometimes impossible task, especially for an untrained person.\"There is also the serious concern that a hack back attack might spark a bigger issue between nations than anyone's considering.Last September, the Ethics + Emerging Sciences Group at Cal Poly released a report called \"Ethics of Hacking Back,\" a neutral look at the issues and laws surrounding the infosec version of \"an eye for an eye.\"The report comes from the stance that reasonable arguments exist to support hacking back. Still, in a summary from Patrick Lin, Ph.D., the group's Director, Cal Poly found that the concept of hacking back fails across a number of categories. \"If meant as a deterrent,\" Lin wrote, \"hacking back would likely not deter malicious and ideological attackers.\"Importantly, the paper cuts to the heart of all hacking back discussions by raising a critical issue: We don't know if it would actually work or not because there is no data. \"Currently,\" Lin said, \"there is no self-reporting of hacking back, because the practice is presumed to be 'likely illegal' according to the U.S. Department of Justice.\"We cannot track what we do not measure. Without that data—a way for individuals and organizations to safely report countermeasures, without fear of being made into criminals—it is difficult to answer the question of whether hacking back has deterrent value, which is an empirical question.More to the ideological point of Graves's bill, Lin points out that hacking back also won't do anything to restore security.By peddling the idea that hacking back could've stopped WannaCry -- ransomware -- ACDC is security snake oil. It's reminiscent of the \"anonymity box\" gold rush that hit Kickstarter after the Snowden snatch and dump, where charlatans sold \"Tor in a box\" promising that their gadgets would've prevented the Sony hack. Just take a recent, dimly-understood hacking disaster and graft on an infantile solution, don't bother to consult people in the trenches, and off we go.When you try to make laws about hacking based on a child's concept of \"getting someone back,\" you're getting very far and away from making yourself secure. It's like trying to make gang warfare productive. Or trying to make it legal to break into someone's house to steal your stuff back and take photos, because they broke into yours, except without anything in your favor of going right. Unless you're really, really good at different kinds of hacking. Spoiler: most everyone in hacking and security isn't, no matter how hard they try to make us all think all hackers are good at everything.It's a smarmy and conceited bill to propose. But that seems to be going around Washington DC lately, so good luck to us.Images: Yuri_Arcurs via Getty Images (Guys at computer); EFE/EPA/RITCHIE B.

Thomas Mageesave Saveshare If hacking back becomes law, what could possibly go wrong? Because escalation always ends well. Violet Blue, @violetblue 29m ago in SecurityComments by D. Thomas MageeRepresentative Tom Graves (R-GA) thinks that when anyone gets hacked -- individuals or companies -- they should be able to \"fight back\" and go \"hunt for hackers outside of their own networks. \" The Active Cyber Defense Certainty (\"ACDC\") Act is getting closer to being put before lawmakers, and the Congressman trying to make \"hacking back\" easy-breezy-legal believes it would've stopped the WannaCry ransomware. Despite its endlessly lulzy acronym, Graves says he \"looks forward to formally introducing ACDC\" to the U. S. House of Representatives in the next few weeks. Hacking back sounds really awesome at first glance, and obviously, especially to lawmakers. The hacking back of \"ACDC\" in action would most likely happen just like on Mr. Robot, or in that movie about black hats. Evil hackers invade a company's computer system and plant a cyber-bomb. Except the company's IT department is actually a crack team of formerly-evil hackers who now work for the good guys (you can tell they're the good guys because they have jobs). Because it's now legal, the good guys dive into The Matrix and defuse the cyber-bomb just in time! Then they fly through the wires to get into the bad guy's computer, instantly downloading his name and address and Tinder profile, sending it instantly to the FBI who bust through the guy's door right as he's trying to wipe the files! Yeah, that's probably how lawmakers see it happening, too. Attacks that go both waysThe bipartisan ACDC bill would let companies who believe they are under ongoing attack break into the computer of whomever they think is attacking them, for the purposes of stopping the attack or gathering info for law enforcement. According to early press, the bill \"includes caveats such as you cannot destroy data on another person's computer, cause physical injury to someone or create a threat to public safety. This is Rep Graves's second attempt at making ACDC work out with all his friends. His May 25th revision of the legislation included attempts at limiting collateral damage, which as you may have suspected, is a particular criticism of people who work in infosec. According to Politico, who had the early scoop on the new version:Key changes include: a mandatory reporting requirement for entities that use active-defense technique to help federal law enforcement ensure such tools are used responsibly; a two-year sunset clause that would make Congress revisit the law in order to make changes; and an exemption allowing people or companies to recover their lost data if it's found using defensive techniques and can be grabbed back without destroying other data. Setting aside the naive idea that digital secrets can somehow be \"stolen back,\" just that information alone diagrams why hacking back generally isn't considered a great idea by most. Brian Bartholomew, senior security researcher at Kaspersky Lab, told Engadget, \"While the proposal's intent is to make it more difficult for an attack to be successful, it also raises major concern within the community. \" He explained that for starters, it's impossible to contain what data the victim touches when they're hacking back, destroying the bill's rule that victims only mess with their own stolen property. \"Another concern is for chain of custody preservation,\" Bartholomew told Engadget, even if victims tell law enforcement what they're about to do. \"Providing a 'plan of action' is a far cry from possessing the proper training or legal expertise on how to preserve evidence that will be upheld in a court of law,\" he explained. \"It is only a matter of time until the first criminal is prosecuted and evidence [is] thrown out due to improper chain of custody or is hard and usually wrong when not done by teams of professional analysts. And even then they get it wrong thanks to the incredible skills attackers have at what's called \"false flagging\" -- making attacks look like they're from someone else. Bartholomew, who co-authored the leading research on \"false flag operations\" agreed:\"As it has been demonstrated many times before, attackers are becoming more and more aware of techniques to throw defenders off their scent and lead them down a wrong path. \"\"Pointing the proverbial finger at another attacker is becoming more commonplace and with the introduction of this bill, the possible outcome of such an act can potentially be devastating. Performing proper attribution of an attack is an already difficult and sometimes impossible task, especially for an untrained person. \"There is also the serious concern that a hack back attack might spark a bigger issue between nations than anyone's considering. Last September, the Ethics + Emerging Sciences Group at Cal Poly released a report called \"Ethics of Hacking Back,\" a neutral look at the issues and laws surrounding the infosec version of \"an eye for an eye. \"The report comes from the stance that reasonable arguments exist to support hacking back. Still, in a summary from Patrick Lin, Ph. D. , the group's Director, Cal Poly found that the concept of hacking back fails across a number of categories. \"If meant as a deterrent,\" Lin wrote, \"hacking back would likely not deter malicious and ideological the paper cuts to the heart of all hacking back discussions by raising a critical issue: We don't know if it would actually work or not because there is no data. \"Currently,\" Lin said, \"there is no self-reporting of hacking back, because the practice is presumed to be 'likely illegal' according to the U. S. Department of Justice. \"We cannot track what we do not measure. Without that data—a way for individuals and organizations to safely report countermeasures, without fear of being made into criminals—it is difficult to answer the question of whether hacking back has deterrent value, which is an empirical question. More to the ideological point of Graves's bill, Lin points out that hacking back also won't do anything to restore security. By peddling the idea that hacking back could've stopped WannaCry -- ransomware -- ACDC is security snake oil. It's reminiscent of the \"anonymity box\" gold rush that hit Kickstarter after the Snowden snatch and dump, where charlatans sold \"Tor in a box\" promising that their gadgets would've prevented the Sony hack. Just take a recent, dimly-understood hacking disaster and graft on an infantile solution, don't bother to consult people in the trenches, and off we go. When you try to make laws about hacking based on a child's concept of \"getting someone back,\" you're getting very far and away from making yourself secure. It's like trying to make gang warfare productive. Or trying to make it legal to break into someone's house to steal your stuff back and take photos, because they broke into yours, except without anything in your favor of going right. Unless you're really, really good at different kinds of hacking. Spoiler: most everyone in hacking and security isn't, no matter how hard they try to make us all think all hackers are good at everything. It's a smarmy and conceited bill to propose. But that seems to be going around Washington DC lately, so good luck to us. Images: Yuri_Arcurs via Getty Images (Guys at computer); EFE/EPA/RITCHIE B.

It’s rolling out “Related Articles” that appear below news links to stories lots of people are posting about on Facebook, or that are suspected to be false news and have been externally fact checked by Facebook’s partners. Appearing before someone reads, Related Articles will surface links to additional reporting on the same topic to provide different view points, and to truthiness reports from the fact checkers.If users see drastically different angles when they compare a story to its Related Articles, they might deem it suspicious and skip it, be less likely to believe or share it, or could click through the Related Articles and make up their own mind. That could reduce the spread and impact of false news without Facebook itself having to be the honesty police. Related Articles could also balance out some of the radical invective that can subtly polarize the populace.Pre-click Related Articles are rolling out in the US, Germany, France, and Nederlands today. These countries were chosen to get the roll out first because Facebook has established fact checking partnerships there. “We don’t want to be and are not the arbiters of the truth. The fact checkers can give the signal of whether a story is true or false” says Facebook News Feed integrity product manager Tessa Lyons.Meanwhile, Facebook’s machine learning algorithm has improved its accuracy and speed, so the social network  will now have it send more potential hoaxes to fact checkers. Lyons explains that the speed is important because “The sooner we can get potential false new stories to fact checkers, the sooner that they can review them, and the more we reduce the number of people who are actually exposed to them.”Facebook has shown Related Articles after people click links since at least 2014. Even then it was getting flack for dispensing fake news. In April of this year Facebook tested the new pre-click version as part of its multi-prong attack on fake news following criticism that misinformation influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election. That includes downranking hoaxes and click bait, reducing referral traffic to ad-filled spam sites to cut off their funding, and promoting local journalism and news literacy. Most directly, it partnered with Snopes, AP, PolitiFact and others external agencies so it can add warning labels to stories externally vetted as false.“People told us that Related Articles gave them more context about topics and that having more context helps them make more informed decisions and about what they read and what they decide to share” Lyons tells me. “Seeing Fact Checker’s articles in Related Articles actually helps people identify whether what they’re reading is misleading or false.”Facebook won’t be personalizing the Related Articles that show a column of thumbnail images and headlines below a link story. However, it does utilize other quality signals from News Feed ranking to show the optimal alternative takes. Thankfully, Lyons says Facebook doesn’t plan to put any ads in the Related Articles box.So how does Facebook avoid accidentally showing more fake news in Related Articles? Facebook tells me it uses the same signals as its Trending section, and disqualifies posts that lots of people are commenting on or reporting as false. No humans are involved in the process, which at least removes the potential for direct bias, though humans tend to code their subconscious biases into their algorithms.If Facebook can’t convince the world it’s got a real handle on the fake news problem, it may see people tune into the News Feed or click its links less. That interferes with Facebook’s ad-driven business model and its mission. Plus, it’s liable to get blamed for future election results.While objectively fake news gets the majority of the attention, it’s exaggeration and warped opinion that are much more prevalent and therefore potentially polarizing. If extreme right and left publishers’ articles get paired with centrist Related Articles, it could dissuade people from blindly swallowing the rants and raves that tear society apart.Featured Image: Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch0SHARESAdvertisementAdvertisement Newsletter SubscriptionsThe Daily CrunchGet the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inboxTC Weekly RoundupGet a weekly recap of the biggest tech storiesCrunchbase DailyThe latest startup funding announcementsEnter AddressSubscribeSEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report Instagram Stories Turns One | Crunch ReportWatch More Episodesfake newsFacebookAppsPopular Posts Featured Stories Instagram Stories Turns One | Crunch ReportVIDEO | 3:38 | Crunch Report WTF is bitcoin cash and is it worth anything?13 hours ago | Fitz Tepper Eat the suburbs16 hours ago | John Biggs Meadow is the Amazon of weed16 hours ago | Josh Constine Instagram Stories turns 1 as daily use surpasses Snapchat21 hours ago | Josh ConstineLatest From Mobile LG confirms its next smartphone will feature a massive six-inch OLED screen3 hours ago | Jon Russell ‘Paranormal Activity’ director Oren Peli launches a new social app8 hours ago | Anthony Ha Apple Pay is coming to Sweden, Denmark, Finland, the UAE and more banks16 hours ago | Romain Dillet Hustle scores $8M to kill telemarketing with personalized texts18 hours ago | Josh Constine Comment moderation powered by  Up NextSmall business loan platform Kabbage nabs $250M from SoftbankPosted 20 minutes ago  CrunchBoardJob ListingsSales &amp; Marketing Support Specialist @ Athos at Athos (Redwood City, CA, United States)Sr. Lead Software Engineer at Neighborly Labs, Inc.

From throwing money at training in in-demand fields like coding, to simply making life easier for people in low-wage positions, Mountain View is looking to the future. For example, the internet juggernaut knows that college isn't for everyone, so it's working on a tool so people can easily compare vocational and technical training programs.

It sounds a lot like what Geico offers -- passive income when you're not able to clock in to work. And to help people find jobs in the first place, Google is giving money to French company Bayes Impact, which uses machine learning to analyze job-seeking strategies and listings to make finding your dream position less of a grind.Coupled with Google Hire, it hints that the firm might be ahead of the curve when it comes to modern employment.

Steve Dent, @stevetdent       17m ago              in WearablesComments 112SharesShareTweetShareSaveAOLWith thousands of apps and Oculus behind it, Samsung's Gear VR is already a great virtual reality headset for Galaxy S8 and S8+ owners, and comes with a new controller to boot. It's always good to have more choice, though, and users of Samsung's flagship smartphones can now use Google's Daydream View, too. On a Google+ post, the search giant confirmed that \"the Daydream-ready update is rolling out now to Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+\" smartphones.While lagging behind Samsung in terms of games and apps, the Daydream View made a strong debut thanks in large part to its comfortable cloth construction. It also comes with a small motion controller, and when it was unveiled, the Gear VR didn't have one -- you had to buy a separate gamepad or make do with with a touchpad on the side of the headset. Shortly after the Daydream VR launch, Samsung unveiled a new Gear VR and controller for the Galaxy S8, S7 and S6 smartphones.The Galaxy S8 or S8+ confer the same benefits to the Daydream VR headset as to the Gear VR. Both phones have arguably the best AMOLED screens on the market with nearly the highest resolutions (2,960 x 1,440) for crisp viewing, fast processors to crunch games and plenty of RAM.

Steve Dent, @stevetdent 17m ago in WearablesComments thousands of apps and Oculus behind it, Samsung's Gear VR is already a great virtual reality headset for Galaxy S8 and S8+ owners, and comes with a new controller to boot. It's always good to have more choice, though, and users of Samsung's flagship smartphones can now use Google's Daydream View, too. On a Google+ post, the search giant confirmed that \"the Daydream-ready update is rolling out now to Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+\" smartphones. While lagging behind Samsung in terms of games and apps, the Daydream View made a strong debut thanks in large part to its comfortable cloth construction. It also comes with a small motion controller, and when it was unveiled, the Gear VR didn't have one -- you had to buy a separate gamepad or make do with with a touchpad on the side of the headset. Shortly after the Daydream VR launch, Samsung unveiled a new Gear VR and controller for the Galaxy S8, S7 and S6 smartphones. The Galaxy S8 or S8+ confer the same benefits to the Daydream VR headset as to the Gear VR. Both phones have arguably the best AMOLED screens on the market with nearly the highest resolutions (2,960 x 1,440) for crisp viewing, fast processors to crunch games and plenty of RAM. They also feature expandable microSD storage up to 256GB -- indispensable for VR video files, which are often enormous. If you're looking at the Daydream VR, it's currently on sale for a limited time in the US at $60 instead of $80. The Daydream VR app is now available on Google Play and should work on your Galaxy S8 or S8+ with no OTA update necessary, users are reporting.

A team of MIT CSAIL researchers have developed an artificial intelligence system that has the potential to evolve into that kind of application. They call the AI Pic2Recipe, because it can predict the ingredients and recipe used to make a dish from a single snapshot. If that sounds familia, it's probably because of \"See Food,\" the fictional app that made an appearance in HBO's Silicon Valley, and a new-ish Pinterest feature that recognizes the most prominent ingredients in a picture of food.Other teams and institutions are also working on similar projects, and a common issue is the lack of samples that leads to limited accuracy. The team had to scour various social networks and websites, such as All Recipes and Food, to collect 1 million recipes. They then annotated the collection with more information about their ingredients and used the database to train a neural network.The result? Their system can identify ingredients like like flour, eggs and butter and can spit out the correct recipe for the dish in an image 65 percent of the time. CSAIL graduate student and lead author Nick Hynes explains:\"This could potentially help people figure out what's in their food when they don't have explicit nutritional information. For example, if you know what ingredients went into a dish but not the amount, you can take a photo, enter the ingredients, and run the model to find a similar recipe with known quantities, and then use that information to approximate your own meal.\"Before you can use it as part of your fitness regimen, though, the team still has to work on making it more accurate. They're also developing its ability to infer how a dish is prepared and to distinguish one ingredient from another.

But in her new book, the unusually titled Prince Lestat and the Realms of Atlantis (out today), Rice has shockingly redefined her own creation—and she told io9 why.AdvertisementAs I mentioned last week, I’ve been dying to talk about Realms of Atlantis because of how mind-boggling it is, but also how daring—even to me, someone who hadn’t read a Vampire Chronicles book in more than two decades. Honestly, in terms of how much it up-ends its own mythology, I’m hard-pressed to think of another spoiler that changes its universe more fundamentally. But I have to reveal it in order for the interview to make sense, so consider this an ultimate....Advertisement..Sorry, I really want to make sure no one who wants to avoid spoilers sees this.Sponsored..AdvertisementAdvertisement..Aliens. AdvertisementAliens have arrived in The Vampire Chronicles. Well, more specifically, they arrived thousands of years ago, but they are hugely responsible for the existence of all vampires, as well as Atlantis.Before Realms of Atlantis, Lestat and his brethren only knew that the vampire’s curse came to be when a bloodthirsty spirit named Amel possessed the ancient Egyptian queen Akasha (the titular Queen of the Damned). It is Amel’s spirit that can be passed from vampire to vampire, connecting them all, and giving vampires their powers and weaknesses. In Prince Lestat (2014), it’s discovered that Amel is still conscious in this neural vampire network, but primarily residing in the spiritual core of the vampires… which Lestat has absorbed after the defeat of Akasha.But Amel is not a spirit… at least not originally. As Realms reveals, he is also the founder of Atlantis, a coastal city of unbelievably advanced technology, around 10,000 years ago. The reason he’s so smart is because he was abducted by aliens named Bravennans, modified, and sent to Earth for reasons I won’t spoil. When he rebels the aliens destroy Atlantis, and Amel somehow becomes a spirit, but he also fuses with a special Atlantean technology that ends up forming the essence of everything that makes a vampire a vampire—an essence that can be measured and altered scientifically.AdvertisementAdvertisementI don’t expect everyone to like Rice’s massive, massive alteration to her mythos, but I genuinely enjoyed the book, and I loved the audacity of it. It was fascinating to see the classic, gothic world of Lestat suddenly, completely upended—but also to see the vampires engaging and embracing the modern world, forming a real community, and, most of all, discovering that their existence, which they once thought to be a divine curse, is actually the result of science—otherworldly science, but science all the same. (And guys? There are so many more surprises I didn’t spoil.)But all of this is preamble. Let Rice herself explain why the Realms of Atlantis contains these shocking revelations, why Rice thinks people shouldn’t be surprised, and what comes next for Lestat. (And check out the first part of our interview here.)                        $17                    Prince Lestat and the Realms of Atlantis: The Vampire ChroniclesFrom amazon35 purchased by readersGizmodo Media Group may get a commissionBuy nowio9: With Prince Lestat and the Realms of Atlantis, I think you may have invented the genre of gothic science-fiction.AdvertisementAnne Rice: I see what you mean. Well, I [started] all this with a great emphasis on gothic romance. I wanted these vampires to be dressed in black velvet, wearing white lace. I wanted them to be beautiful and seductive. I wanted them to be like the movie I saw as a child, called Dracula’s Daughter (1936). It involved this gothic, beautiful, sensitive, wonderful countess who was in fact the daughter of Dracula, and she was an artist living in London and it was a very romantic presentation of the vampire as a tortured soul. And I loved that. And that was where I was at in the beginning; I wanted these beautiful, irresistible tragic characters to appeal to the reader and for the reader to fall in love with them.But I have never seen science fiction as in any way anathema to this. Very early on, I did a signing in a science fiction bookstore in 1976, and those science fiction readers who came to that store, they took the vampires absolutely seriously. It was amazing. They walked in and they asked metaphysical questions about Louis’ quest for meaning. And I just had such respect for them.AdvertisementI’m very aware of this scifi world, [so I know] it dips a lot into—maybe not the gothic, but it tips into poetry. I mean, Robert Heinlein’s stories are just filled with poetry. Ray Bradbury is filled with poetic meaning. And it’s so—to me, there was always this reverence to science fiction. So I don’t have any fear of going there.My vampires are so real to me, their gothic allure is so well-established that I don’t feel in any way threatened by the hard cult science of science fiction. I go for the metaphysical and poetic side of science fiction. So, it’s exciting to me to work with both. It really is. And you know, I hope maybe some scifi readers will give this book a chance whereas maybe they weren’t interested in vampire fiction before.AdvertisementAre you worried that some fans might be put off on changing the vampires’ origin from something supernatural to something extraterrestrial?Rice: I’ve always been looking for that bottom line. I’m always going back to where it all started, and discovering more about “how” it started.This [continues] the process. It’s just digging back even further. Like, what was this entity that came to Akasha? What was it before? Where did it come from? And so to me it’s all very logical and it’s all of a piece.AdvertisementSomeone might be disappointed. They might have been hoping for a more religious or a more purely mysterious explanation, but I’ve never actually offered that to readers. I’ve always offered the biological reality for these palpable beings. They occupy space. They are subject to physical rules, just as we are.That, to me, is the great dramatic tension. They have to deal with physical limitations even though they appear to be supernatural. They aren’t. They’re preternatural. What we think of as the supernatural maybe isn’t supernatural at all. It’s not the abolition of everything we believe in the material world—it’s another dimension of the material world that we have yet to really fathom.AdvertisementEven beyond the big reveal about Atlantis and the aliens, the book doesn’t come close to answering all the mysteries in the series. Correct me if I’m wrong, but there are still ghosts, and there are spirits besides them, and their origin is still unknown. Rice: Where did the spirits come from? And the story of Amel—do we know the full truth? Or is there yet more to be discovered? Is Amel wrong about some of the things he thinks about himself and where he came from? Was Amel the victim of lies about himself?AdvertisementI’m always dealing with that idea of where the soul comes from. Can a droid have a soul, simply because of awareness? Can it generate a soul? Is a soul made of nanoparticles? All of that I think is important.But do you already know the answers to these mysteries? The origins of ghosts and spirits in your world?Rice: I have questions. My questions bump up against the reality that humans just don’t know. I mean, that’s something I live with at my age now, that I do not know what happens after death, if anything happens after death. I do not know and I can’t know and frankly I don’t believe people that tell me they know. So I don’t know that I can ever offer to the readers an absolute explanation for something as the real reason for why we’re here and where we came from—I don’t think that’s possible.AdvertisementBut I can certainly ask a lot of really interesting questions. And I can imagine a lot of very interesting beings based on what we know of ghosts, apparitions, possession and so forth.Are there any other details you can tell us about Lestat’s future, and/or the next book?AdvertisementRice: He’ll still be the prince and he’ll still be at the chateau and he will still have his closest confidants there. He will have Marius and Armand and Louis and Fareed and Gregory and he will confront yet another huge threat. And the threats that they’re confronting are coming out of the internet age. They’re confronting the fact that the internet age is enabling immortals and occult beings to come together as never before. It’s enabling them to find each other, it’s enabling them to talk to each other—so they’re confronting—the crises they’re confronting are modern crises. And I think that’s a thrilling idea.I like the idea of bringing all that charm and beauty and enchantment into the present time and fusing it with the modern challenges. And think of what the internet must mean to ghosts and spirits, my god. They can find each other. They can find other entities like themselves for whom they may have been divided for centuries.AdvertisementThat’s very much a theme in Prince Lestat, too. How is the internet impacting all of this? Little vampire Benjy is one of my favorite characters. He’s 12 years old when he’s made a vampire, and he’s a Bedouin from the nation of Israel. And he has a sense of tribe and a sense of tribal loyalties and he starts using the internet to reach other vampires and to talk to the whole world of vampires—and in a sense, he helps bring them together as a worldwide tribe. And that’s very much behind these books.Before the Atlantis reveal, I was shocked to see not just how much vampires had embraced the modern age, and how positively, but also how they’d formed an actual community together. It’s so different from the original books, but it’s also clearly a part of the original Vampire Chronicles.Rice: That’s true. There was a story unfolding about the past and now it’s the present, it goes even deeper into the past to find answers, but also to better live in the present. To better define themselves in the present. You know, in the past they sometimes got answers and they’re just left with despair, you know? The next Prince Lestat book, as I call them—the next one will also be named “Prince Lestat and...”—will also be a book where the past is seen entirely in the terms of the vigorous and vital existence of the present.AdvertisementDo you anticipate the next book or books containing a bombshell as world-changing as Realms of Atlantis has?Rice: I don’t know. I’m not sure. If other things open up as I’m writing, maybe so. The thing with me is to surrender. To surrender to where it goes. To establish the reality for myself—these characters exist, they’re really there, they’re talking to me—and to see where they’re taking me. And it’s possible there would be another bombshell.AdvertisementYou know, until you said that word, “bombshell,” I didn’t really see it that way. So I don’t know. I think the next one could perhaps be as radical. Would that be the word? Is it possible? It’s possible. What I don’t want to lose right now—and I never want to lose—is the court and Lestat as the prince as the community. I don’t want to lose that again. And I’m not going to risk it. I’ve done that in the past. I’ve risked it. I’ve thrown it away at the end of books. Because I had to! It didn’t sustain for me. It just didn’t. And I was so beaten up on by what happened in the book that I crawled out of the book and didn’t take anything positive with me. But that’s not the way it is now.Last question. I originally meant this to be a little silly, based on the unexpectedness of Atlantis, but after our discussion... could you envision a story in which Lestat went to the moon? AdvertisementRice: I wouldn’t rule it out. I might go in that direction. I wouldn’t say he’s going to the moon, necessarily, but… it could happen. This book has opened up the possibilities of extraterrestrial life. I wouldn’t rule it out. I want to see what happens.If there’s going to be an explanation of what happens to a vampire’s physiology in space, given that days and nights simply don’t exist, there’s no one better to answer that question than you. Rice: Well that’s great. That’s wonderful. I appreciate that very much. If I’ll have an answer, I don’t know...but I am very excited about getting into this [next] book. It’s too early to know for sure which way it’s going to go. I’ve got some ideas, I’ve got a map... but I don’t know where I’ll land.Anne Rice Reveals Why She Brought the Vampire Lestat to the Realms of AtlantisAnne Rice Reveals Why She Brought the Vampire Lestat to the Realms of AtlantisAnne Rice Reveals Why She Brought the…If you haven’t read Prince Lestat, Anne Rice’s most recent Vampire Chronicles book, a lot has…Read more Read moreRob Brickenrob.bricken@gizmodo.com@robbrickenRob Bricken is the Editor of io9, yo.Gear from Kinja DealsThe New \"World's Fastest\" Gaming MouseBestsellers: PlayStation PlusToday's Best Lifestyle Deals: Pajamas and Slippers, MAC Cosmetics, Extended Cyber Monday SalesReply32 repliesLeave a replyYou may also likeGizmodoReddit Is Tearing Itself ApartToday 10:20amThe SlotMelania Trump Threatens to Sue Over Barron Trump Video Made by Autistic Young Man39 minutes agoSploidSo How Close Do You Live to a Nuclear Bomb?Today 12:50pmRecent from Rob Bricken1323329.1Kio9 · Rob BrickenThe Big DC/CW Crossover Forgot to Begin Last NightToday 10:00am20703215.7Kio9 · Rob BrickenWhat the Hell Is The Walking Dead Even DoingYesterday 10:55am56426.2Kio9 · Rob BrickenAnne Rice Reveals Why She Brought the Vampire Lestat to the Realms of Atlantis11/22/16 4:27pmShareTweetAbout BlogNeed Help?Content GuideGizmodo StoreRedirecting to the Gizmodo store in  Disclaimer: You are leaving a Gizmodo Media Group, LLC website and going to a third party site, which is subject to its own privacy policy and terms of use.ContinuePermissionsPrivacyTerms of UseAdvertisingJobsRSS©2016 Gizmodo Media GroupKinja is in read-only mode.

But in her new book, the unusually titled Prince Lestat and the Realms of Atlantis (out today), Rice has shockingly redefined her own creation—and she told io9 why. AdvertisementAs I mentioned last week, I’ve been dying to talk about Realms of Atlantis because of how mind-boggling it is, but also how daring—even to me, someone who hadn’t read a Vampire Chronicles book in more than two decades. Honestly, in terms of how much it up-ends its own mythology, I’m hard-pressed to think of another spoiler that changes its universe more fundamentally. But I have to reveal it in order for the interview to make sense, so consider this an I really want to make sure no one who wants to avoid spoilers sees AdvertisementAliens have arrived in The Vampire Chronicles. Well, more specifically, they arrived thousands of years ago, but they are hugely responsible for the existence of all vampires, as well as Atlantis. Before Realms of Atlantis, Lestat and his brethren only knew that the vampire’s curse came to be when a bloodthirsty spirit named Amel possessed the ancient Egyptian queen Akasha (the titular Queen of the Damned). It is Amel’s spirit that can be passed from vampire to vampire, connecting them all, and giving vampires their powers and weaknesses. In Prince Lestat (2014), it’s discovered that Amel is still conscious in this neural vampire network, but primarily residing in the spiritual core of the vampires… which Lestat has absorbed after the defeat of Akasha. But Amel is not a spirit… at least not originally. As Realms reveals, he is also the founder of Atlantis, a coastal city of unbelievably advanced technology, around 10,000 years ago. The reason he’s so smart is because he was abducted by aliens named Bravennans, modified, and sent to Earth for reasons I won’t spoil. When he rebels the aliens destroy Atlantis, and Amel somehow becomes a spirit, but he also fuses with a special Atlantean technology that ends up forming the essence of everything that makes a vampire a vampire—an essence that can be measured and altered don’t expect everyone to like Rice’s massive, massive alteration to her mythos, but I genuinely enjoyed the book, and I loved the audacity of it. It was fascinating to see the classic, gothic world of Lestat suddenly, completely upended—but also to see the vampires engaging and embracing the modern world, forming a real community, and, most of all, discovering that their existence, which they once thought to be a divine curse, is actually the result of science—otherworldly science, but science all the same. (And guys? There are so many more surprises I didn’t spoil. )But all of this is preamble. Let Rice herself explain why the Realms of Atlantis contains these shocking revelations, why Rice thinks people shouldn’t be surprised, and what comes next for Lestat. (And check out the first part of our interview here. ) $17 Prince Lestat and the Realms of Atlantis: The Vampire ChroniclesFrom amazon35 purchased by readersGizmodo Media Group may get a commissionBuy nowio9: With Prince Lestat and the Realms of Atlantis, I think you may have invented the genre of gothic Rice: I see what you mean. Well, I [started] all this with a great emphasis on gothic romance. I wanted these vampires to be dressed in black velvet, wearing white lace. I wanted them to be beautiful and seductive. I wanted them to be like the movie I saw as a child, called Dracula’s Daughter (1936). It involved this gothic, beautiful, sensitive, wonderful countess who was in fact the daughter of Dracula, and she was an artist living in London and it was a very romantic presentation of the vampire as a tortured soul. And I loved that. And that was where I was at in the beginning; I wanted these beautiful, irresistible tragic characters to appeal to the reader and for the reader to fall in love with them. But I have never seen science fiction as in any way anathema to this. Very early on, I did a signing in a science fiction bookstore in 1976, and those science fiction readers who came to that store, they took the vampires absolutely seriously. It was amazing. They walked in and they asked metaphysical questions about Louis’ quest for meaning. And I just had such respect for very aware of this scifi world, [so I know] it dips a lot into—maybe not the gothic, but it tips into poetry. I mean, Robert Heinlein’s stories are just filled with poetry. Ray Bradbury is filled with poetic meaning. And it’s so—to me, there was always this reverence to science fiction. So I don’t have any fear of going there. My vampires are so real to me, their gothic allure is so well-established that I don’t feel in any way threatened by the hard cult science of science fiction. I go for the metaphysical and poetic side of science fiction. So, it’s exciting to me to work with both. It really is. And you know, I hope maybe some scifi readers will give this book a chance whereas maybe they weren’t interested in vampire fiction you worried that some fans might be put off on changing the vampires’ origin from something supernatural to something I’ve always been looking for that bottom line. I’m always going back to where it all started, and discovering more about “how” it started. This [continues] the process. It’s just digging back even further.

As of this very moment I’ve had the new 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar for just a few hours. It’s small, sturdy, and typing my password in was pleasant enough. That Touch Bar looks really neat too, and when I set up Touch ID to login from the Touch Bar, I felt like I was in the future.AdvertisementBut $2,500 worth of overpriced, hyper-engineered Apple laptop has now crashed 23 times—a full dozen in the first hour I had this thing.The last 11 crashes occurred more sporadically because I spent the last hour and a half on three different calls with Apple in an effort to resolve the problem. I will say that the company’s tech support personnel were very kind and contacting them was easy. You sign in to your Apple account on the support website, answer a question, and a call is scheduled. The website had me run a few tests while Apple sets up the call, then your phone rings, and there’s a gracious member of tech support on the line.AdvertisementThe first representative guided me through resetting my PRAM and arranged a callback. The computer crashed. Rep Two had me reinstall the OS. The computer crashed. Rep Three saw the detailed notes and immediately said I needed to speak to a MacBook Supervisor (whatever that is). I was then placed on hold for ten minutes. The MacBook Supervisor took one look at the issue and put me in contact with the internet sales team.So tomorrow I will pack up my brand new MacBook Pro. It will not be hard, apart from keeping the device stable enough to remove all my personal information. The charger never even came out of its wrapper. The box is still sitting on top of its packaging on my bed, cellophane shining. I’ll get a new MacBook Pro eventually. First, I have to ship Apple the old and wait for FedEx to tell Apple I’ve shipped it. Then Apple will “start building” me a new one. There is no guarantee of a ship date. Maybe December. Maybe earlier.SponsoredThis is standard operating procedure for Apple, and it makes sense for a company that deals in millions of phones every year. But a $2,500 “custom built” laptop is a far cry from a $600 smartphone. The expectations are higher for that customer base. We expect things like a device that works out of the box—particularly when it’s supposedly “custom built.” If I’m spending $2,500, and they’re specially installing RAM and an i7 processor is it really too much to ask that they test the damn thing before it leaves the factory? There are plenty of smaller companies with cheaper products that do just that. Once upon a time the splurging for an Apple product felt worth it. You were paying for an outstanding operating system and a breezy computing experience, as well as the best tech support in the game. A new computer would have been shipped the moment the return label was created for the old one. Or they might have even encouraged a visit to an Apple Store, where a tech would have been able to physically repair the issue.AdvertisementAdvertisementInstead, my new “custom built” laptop arrived DOA. I’m not the only one with problems, either. While the new 13-inch MacBook Pro only started arriving in users’ hands today, the 15-inch had a few days head start, and numerous owners have flocked to the MacRumors forum to crow about “GPUGate.” Those fancy and woefully underpowered video cards?

I will say that the company’s tech support personnel were very kind and contacting them was easy. You sign in to your Apple account on the support website, answer a question, and a call is scheduled. The website had me run a few tests while Apple sets up the call, then your phone rings, and there’s a gracious member of tech support on the first representative guided me through resetting my PRAM and arranged a callback. The computer crashed. Rep Two had me reinstall the OS. The computer crashed. Rep Three saw the detailed notes and immediately said I needed to speak to a MacBook Supervisor (whatever that is). I was then placed on hold for ten minutes. The MacBook Supervisor took one look at the issue and put me in contact with the internet sales team. So tomorrow I will pack up my brand new MacBook Pro. It will not be hard, apart from keeping the device stable enough to remove all my personal information. The charger never even came out of its wrapper. The box is still sitting on top of its packaging on my bed, cellophane shining. I’ll get a new MacBook Pro eventually. First, I have to ship Apple the old and wait for FedEx to tell Apple I’ve shipped it. Then Apple will “start building” me a new one. There is no guarantee of a ship date. Maybe December. Maybe is standard operating procedure for Apple, and it makes sense for a company that deals in millions of phones every year. But a $2,500 “custom built” laptop is a far cry from a $600 smartphone. The expectations are higher for that customer base. We expect things like a device that works out of the box—particularly when it’s supposedly “custom built. ” If I’m spending $2,500, and they’re specially installing RAM and an i7 processor is it really too much to ask that they test the damn thing before it leaves the factory? There are plenty of smaller companies with cheaper products that do just that. Once upon a time the splurging for an Apple product felt worth it. You were paying for an outstanding operating system and a breezy computing experience, as well as the best tech support in the game. A new computer would have been shipped the moment the return label was created for the old one. Or they might have even encouraged a visit to an Apple Store, where a tech would have been able to physically repair the my new “custom built” laptop arrived DOA. I’m not the only one with problems, either. While the new 13-inch MacBook Pro only started arriving in users’ hands today, the 15-inch had a few days head start, and numerous owners have flocked to the MacRumors forum to crow about “GPUGate. ” Those fancy and woefully underpowered video cards? Are creating some massive glitches on the display. Are you suffering from GPUGate? Did your shiny new laptop also come DOA? Shoot me an email at I’d love to hear more. Alex Editor.

Unfortunately, it only downloads to your built-in storage by default, which can lead to some slow, cluttered phones. If you’d rather use the extra space on your SD card for all those Stranger Things episodes, here’s how.Method #1: Copy Everything to Your SD Card ManuallyYou’ll need to label them yourself, but you can copy Netflix videos easily.The safest way to copy Netflix videos to your SD card is also the most tedious. When Netflix downloads a movie, it’s stored in a nondescript folder on your phone’s built-in storage. You can copy these to your SD card temporarily to save space, but you’ll need to copy them back whenever you want to watch them. Still, it’s a handy way to store extra movies or shows for later, like a long flight or car trip when you’ll have nothing else to do. AdvertisementWhen you download movies or TV shows to your phone, the files on your device won’t have descriptive names, so you’re not going to get BojackHorseman_S01_E01 or anything. Instead, you’ll see a folder with a long, seemingly-random number. If you want to keep a tidy, organized library, download one episode or movie at a time and follow these steps:Open your preferred file manager (we recommend Solid Explorer.)Turn on the option to show hidden files and folders, if you haven’t already. (To do this in Solid Explorer, tap the menu button while browsing, tap “Folder options” then check “Show hidden files.”)Navigate to Device Storage &gt; Android &gt; data &gt; com.netflix.mediaclient &gt; files &gt; Download &gt; .ofHere you’ll see a folder named with a string of numbers. Long-press the folder and tap the scissors icon to cut it to the clipboard.Slide out the left-hand panel in Solid Explorer and tap your SD card. Navigate to the folder you want to store the files in. Tap the circular clipboard icon in the lower-right corner to paste the files.Rename the numbered Netflix folder to add the name of the movie or TV show you just downloaded to the end, but do not delete the number. You’ll need this later.When you want to watch your movie or TV show again, copy the folder back to its original location in step 3. Delete the label you added earlier so only the number remains.If you rename or change any of the files in the .of folder, Netflix won’t recognize or play them. You can add labels while you store them on your SD card temporarily, but you’ll need to put every file and folder back where you found it with exactly the same names. Admittedly, this process is cumbersom—and Netflix might issue an update that blocks it entirely—but it does allow you to store a lot more downloads than you can fit on your internal storage.AdvertisementIf you have an OTG cable—like this one you can buy for less than $5—you can use this same process to store files on flash drives or even external hard drives. If you’re going to go this route, though, your drive will need to use the exFAT file system. If you’re not familiar with it, we explain what it is and how to use it here. This isn’t exactly a convenient way to store movies, but if you already have a properly formatted drive and you want to save some shows for a road trip, this is a handy workaround.Method #2: Set Up Your SD Card As Shared StorageIt’s a bit like your phone and SD card are getting married.Technically, Netflix stores downloaded movies on what’s called your “primary shared storage.” By default, that means your phone’s built-in storage, but you can let your phone “adopt” an SD card to make that space even bigger.There are a few downsides to this method. First, this will reformat your SD card. Before you proceed, you’ll need to back up anything that’s on your SD card. If you’ve already installed apps to your SD card, you should move them back to your phone’s storage for now and back up any data (like photos) in those apps that you can’t recover later. Ideally, you’d follow these steps with a fresh SD card.SponsoredSecond, this can slow your whole phone down if you’re using a slow SD card. Internal storage is faster than some SD cards. When you force apps to install on the card, you can make them slower to launch or run because it takes longer to read that data. Make sure you’re using a fast SD card (like a Class 6 card) if you don’t want to take a performance hit.Finally, once you adopt an SD card, you should never remove it. Android will treat your SD card like it’s part of your phone’s built-in storage space. That means important files will be stored on your card and you can break things if you remove it. If you go this route, be prepared to treat that SD card like it can’t be removed from your phone.AdvertisementAdvertisementAll that said, to turn your SD card into adopted storage, follow these steps:Insert your SD card into your device. If it’s already inserted, remove it then reinsert it.A notification will appear indicating a new drive is detected. Tap “Set Up” in this notification.Tap “Use as internal storage.” This step will erase the SD card.You’ll now be prompted to move extra data to your new storage. You can do this now, or do it later under Settings &gt; Storage &gt; SD Card &gt; Migrate DataYou can choose to do step 4 later, but you’ll probably want to do it before downloading Netflix movies and TV shows. After you adopt the SD card into your built-in storage, Android will treat it like one big drive. All your apps will start using the space on your SD card seamlessly, including Netflix. You won’t even notice a difference as you download every single season of Orange Is the New Black.Eric Ravenscrafteric@lifehacker.com@lordravenscraftSenior Writer for Lifehacker.Start All the DownloadsAll the Best Movies Coming to and Leaving Netflix in November 2016Netflix Has More \"Certified Fresh\" Movies Than Amazon Prime and HBO Now CombinedWhat Those Netflix Stars Actually MeanGear from Kinja DealsSleep Soundly With Hearos XtremeBestsellers: Anker SoundCore Bluetooth Speaker This $50 LED Flood Light Can Change Colors For the HolidaysReply16 repliesLeave a replyYou may also likeSkilletStop Trying to Force Avocados to Ripen and Let Time Do Its JobYesterday 2:30pmLifehackerThe Best PCs You Can Build for $300, $600, and $1200Monday 8:15amio9Spider-Man Takes Flight in the First, Tiny Glimpse at Spider-Man: HomecomingToday 6:17amRecent from Eric Ravenscraft2276.9KLifehacker · Eric RavenscraftHow Do You Deal With Burnout at Work?Today 5:30am64.6KLifehacker · Eric RavenscraftAvoid the \"What the Hell\" Effect to Keep From Ruining Your Habits Too BadlyToday 5:00am111943.6KLifehacker · Eric RavenscraftThis Chart Shows How Computer Literate Most People AreToday 4:30amShareTweetAbout BlogNeed Help?Content GuideLifehacker StoreRedirecting to the Lifehacker store in  Disclaimer: You are leaving a Gizmodo Media Group, LLC website and going to a third party site, which is subject to its own privacy policy and terms of use.ContinuePermissionsPrivacyTerms of UseAdvertisingJobsRSS©2016 Gizmodo Media GroupKinja is in read-only mode.

Advertisement\\u201cWe are going to pray with this baby and we are going to let this baby\\u2019s body bear witness to our nation as we begin the process to elect our next president,\\u201d the priest continues, inanely listing off various levels of government.Ravone calmly presents the viewer with \\u201ca very simple choice.\\u201d To either \\u201celect those who are going to affirm the covenant we have with God or those who reject it.\\u201d Donald Trump is perhaps closer to God than his opponent considering he presumably grabbed his covenant right by the pussy.\\u201cThe testimony of scripture and the testimony of the life of this child point to the critical importance of this election,\\u201d the priest explains. He urges viewers\\u2014of which there were over 250,000\\u2014to choose life. In the description of the video, he asserts that voting for Donald Trump and Republicans in general means you\\u2019re voting to protect children.SponsoredWill a Facebook Live stream of a priest with a dead baby convince people to vote for Trump? Hard to say. Is Frank\\u2019s dead fetus real? Is it even allowed on Facebook? Should it be? In September, the company took down a Pulitzer-winning photograph of a naked Vietnamese girl covered in Napalm. Facebook then reversed its initial decision and reinstated the photo, giving the following statement:After hearing from our community, we looked again at how our Community Standards were applied in this case. An image of a naked child would normally be presumed to violate our Community Standards, and in some countries might even qualify as child pornography. In this case, we recognize the history and global importance of this image in documenting a particular moment in time.We have reached out to Facebook to ask if Pavone\\u2019s content is allowed on the platform and will update the post if we get a response.AdvertisementAdvertisementAccording Facebook\\u2019s community standards, the company removes \\u201cgraphic images when they are shared for sadistic pleasure or to celebrate or glorify violence.\\u201d So I guess it depends if the priest live streamed this dead fetus for \\u201csadistic pleasure.\\u201d One could make a pretty compelling case for that.Here\\u2019s the whole (very disturbing) Facebook Live stream:[Washington Post]Eve Peysereve@gizmodo.com@evepeyserEve Peyser is the night editor at Gizmodo.Facebook livEFacebook Admits Pulitzer-Winning Photograph Is Not Child PornographyFacebook Still Says It's Not a Media Company, Announces Election Day CoverageFormer Facebook Workers: We Routinely Suppressed Conservative NewsGear from Kinja DealsUmbra's Twilight Rod Takes Your Curtains from the Windows to the WallBestsellers:\\u00a0HGST Touro S 1TB 7200RPM Portable DriveSave $20 on One of the Only Inkjet Printers You Should Consider BuyingReply24 repliesLeave a replyYou may also likeThe BestsThe Best Strategy Games On PCToday 7:00pmSploidInteractive Periodic Table Reveals Exactly How We Use All Those ElementsToday 10:28amThe ConcourseThe Entire Plot Of The Next Season Of Game Of Thrones Seems To Have LeakedToday 12:15pmRecent from Eve Peyser37Eve Peyser \\u00b7 Eve PeyserElection?

We hope you like fairies.It should focus less on surprise and more on delight.Apple's paranoia about leaks is misplacedApple's inability to keep its secrets is so bad that even its internal presentation about confidentiality leaked. It reportedly conducted an hour-long briefing titled \\\"Stopping Leakers -- Keeping Confidential at Apple\\\" for about 100 employees to make sure they understood the importance of not leaking information. But that concern is misplaced: Clamping down on leaks won't help Apple's bottom line.The games are free, but you can pay $2 to drop the advertisementsSega Forever makes Genesis classics free on mobileThe Sega Forever collection is five titles meant to begin \\\"a retro revolution that will transport players back through two decades of console gaming.\\\" Starting today, the 1991 version of Sonic the Hedgehog, fan-favorite RPG Phantasy Star II, classic arcade-style beat 'em up Comix Zone, platformer Kid Chameleon and Greek mythology-themed beat 'em up Altered Beast will be available on Google Play and iTunes as free ad-supported games.Can Travis Kalanick's resignation fix Uber?Uber's future is still tied to its founderUber's disruptive effect on the taxi business, went hand in hand with throwing out the rulebook.

Advertisement\\u201cWe are going to pray with this baby and we are going to let this baby\\u2019s body bear witness to our nation as we begin the process to elect our next president,\\u201d the priest continues, inanely listing off various levels of government. Ravone calmly presents the viewer with \\u201ca very simple choice. \\u201d To either \\u201celect those who are going to affirm the covenant we have with God or those who reject it. \\u201d Donald Trump is perhaps closer to God than his opponent considering he presumably grabbed his covenant right by the pussy. \\u201cThe testimony of scripture and the testimony of the life of this child point to the critical importance of this election,\\u201d the priest explains. He urges viewers\\u2014of which there were over 250,000\\u2014to choose life. In the description of the video, he asserts that voting for Donald Trump and Republicans in general means you\\u2019re voting to protect a Facebook Live stream of a priest with a dead baby convince people to vote for Trump? Hard to say. Is Frank\\u2019s dead fetus real? Is it even allowed on Facebook? Should it be? In September, the company took down a Pulitzer-winning photograph of a naked Vietnamese girl covered in Napalm. Facebook then reversed its initial decision and reinstated the photo, giving the following statement:After hearing from our community, we looked again at how our Community Standards were applied in this case. An image of a naked child would normally be presumed to violate our Community Standards, and in some countries might even qualify as child pornography. In this case, we recognize the history and global importance of this image in documenting a particular moment in time. We have reached out to Facebook to ask if Pavone\\u2019s content is allowed on the platform and will update the post if we get a Facebook\\u2019s community standards, the company removes \\u201cgraphic images when they are shared for sadistic pleasure or to celebrate or glorify violence. \\u201d So I guess it depends if the priest live streamed this dead fetus for \\u201csadistic pleasure. \\u201d One could make a pretty compelling case for that.

Richard Lawler, @Rjcc 50m ago in GadgetryComments good morning! You look fabulous. Welcome to Thursday morning. We're reliving the '90s through, as Sega launches a selection of classic hits both with ads and without. We're also talking Instagram and its stealth shills, and new emoji. We hope you like fairies. It should focus less on surprise and more on delight. Apple's paranoia about leaks is misplacedApple's inability to keep its secrets is so bad that even its internal presentation about confidentiality leaked. It reportedly conducted an hour-long briefing titled \\\"Stopping Leakers -- Keeping Confidential at Apple\\\" for about 100 employees to make sure they understood the importance of not leaking information. But that concern is misplaced: Clamping down on leaks won't help Apple's bottom line. The games are free, but you can pay $2 to drop the advertisementsSega Forever makes Genesis classics free on mobileThe Sega Forever collection is five titles meant to begin \\\"a retro revolution that will transport players back through two decades of console gaming. \\\" Starting today, the 1991 version of Sonic the Hedgehog, fan-favorite RPG Phantasy Star II, classic arcade-style beat 'em up Comix Zone, platformer Kid Chameleon and Greek mythology-themed beat 'em up Altered Beast will be available on Google Play and iTunes as free ad-supported games. Can Travis Kalanick's resignation fix Uber? Uber's future is still tied to its founderUber's disruptive effect on the taxi business, went hand in hand with throwing out the rulebook. Some of the rules avoided, however, included strict background checks on drivers, and safety laws to ensure that drivers didn't work for too long, according to Uber co-founder Garrett Camp, who sits as chairperson of the company's board. He said the team \\\"failed to build some of the systems that every company needs to scale successfully. \\\" Those systems included restrictions on employees sexually harassing their colleagues and preventing engineers from developing tools to hinder law enforcement investigations. Following Travis Kalanick's resignation, can Uber change enough? Your next set of emoji includes zombies, vampires, fairies and dinosaurs. The latest emoji update is a playful oneFinally, the monocle emoji. A new tool could make hidden ads more obvious -- if shills use it. Instagram gives social media influencers the benefit of the doubtsocial media platform. The \\\"Paid partnership with [enter brand name here]\\\" post format is designed for users who want to advertise products on their page, letting them easily disclose when one of their posts is an ad. Instagram says this is an effort to bring the platform some much-needed transparency. The feature is set to roll out in the coming weeks to a \\\"small number\\\" of creators and businesses, according to the company. The question remains: Will influencers actually use the feature? And what will happen if they don't? The monsters caught with cheating tools may not behave normally. 'Pok\\u00e9mon Go' will flag creatures caught using cheatsNiantic has decided that forcing Pok\\u00e9mon Go cheaters to a life of catching Pidgeys isn't quite enough punishment. Now, any Pok\\u00e9mon caught using \\\"third-party services that circumvent normal gameplay\\\" will be marked with a slash in people's inventories and \\\"may not behave as expected. \\\"But wait, there's more.

K. A. the Punisher, in 'Daredevil' Season 2Image: netflixBy Proma Khosla2016-04-29 13:57:51 UTCHell's Kitchen continues to burn. With success of Daredevil, the critical acclaim of Jessica Jones, and mounting excitement for Luke Cage and Iron Fist — all leading up to a Defenders miniseries — Marvel is adding another name to its slate of Netflix properties. SEE ALSO: 'Daredevil' Season 2 is crowded, which just means there's more to loveThe new series will focus on The Punisher, and will star Jon Bernthal in the title role — reprising a part he first played on Daredevil Season 2. Hannibal's Steve Lightfoot will serve as showrunner. News of the show was first reported by Entertainment Weekly and confirmed by Netflix on Friday. The Punisher was first introduced in Frank Miller's Daredevil comics as a vengeful and violent vigilante – a darker shade of Daredevil and a warning of what Matt Murdock could become if he veered off his chosen path. Castle is disillusioned by war and fueled by hatred, determined to avenge the deaths of his family and any other casualties of bigger battle. The Punisher series doesn't yet have a premiere date.

But Branson has a new idea for the meantime: Why not launch small satellites into space? Called Virgin Orbit, Branson’s newest space venture will be led by former Boeing executive Dan Hart. “By offering low cost and frequent service to space, the team is revolutionizing the small satellite market within the promising space economy,” Branson bragged on his space strategy, however, is a little odd, so we’ve come up with a name for it: The Reverse Musk™. How do you pull off a Reverse Musk™? You start with the really hard stuff and then give up and try the more humble projects you should’ve been working on two decades ago. Elon Musk founded SpaceX in 2002 with bold dreams of eventually propelling humans into space—to Mars and beyond. But Musk realized that you had to start with the more modest stuff. Over the next decade, SpaceX built rockets and sent capsules to the International Space Station, and launched satellites. And all of those things paid off. Musk now talks about how he wants to send space tourists around the moon by the end of 2018. And even though it’s a tremendously ambitious goal, some people believe he can do it. Why? Musk started with the “smaller” stuff like launching satellites. Getting humans to the moon and Mars may have been the ultimate goal, but Musk clearly knew that you had to learn to walk before you could run. SponsoredBranson has always been about the opposite. Yes, he’s been developing his own rockets, and spaceships—one that tragically and infamously exploded in 2014, killing a pilot. But he only recently pursued private contracts to do the more modest stuff, like launching satellites into space, that ultimately teaches lessons that you can use for manned space travel. Branson did, however, get the state of New Mexico to pay $250 million for a spaceship graveyard. So it’s not like he wasn’t busy spending other people’s money. Just not in a way that benefited very many has been my longheld dream to open access to space to change the world for good,” Branson said in a statement about his new company. “We have been striving to do that by manufacturing vehicles of the future, enabling the small satellite revolution, and preparing commercial space flight for many more humans to reach space and see our home planet. ”“I’m thrilled that our small satellite launch service has now progressed to the point it merits the formation of its own company, Virgin Orbit, and a new president in Dan with decades of deep experience and success in a broad variety of space programs. ”Will Virgin Orbit be successful? Hopefully. But it’s really something he should’ve started with back in the Galactic officials said 100 people already have paid $200,000 apiece to fly into space,” a story from the Associated Press in 2005 promised. “They include actress Victoria Principal, who told the news conference she looked forward to being on the first civilian flight of Virgin Galactic, perhaps as soon as 2008. ”Like we said, we’re still rooting for Branson’s The Reverse Musk™, even if he has almost 20 years of failed promises in his wake. Hopefully this one takes off. Do you get it? I said, I hope this one takes off. Like the spaceships. They take off.

Shonda Rhimes is bringing her award-winning talents to NetflixPosted 25 minutes ago by Jonathan Shieber StoryGoDaddy tells white supremacist site Daily Stormer to find a new domain providerShonda Rhimes is coming to Netflix. The writer/producer whose television empire spans from West Coast hospitals to a scandal-wracked West Wing is joining the Netflix stable of exclusive content. It\\u2019s a blow to Rhimes\\u2019 longtime distributors at ABC, whose parent company Disney announced earlier this week that they\\u2019d be pulling their titles from Netflix\\u2019s streaming service. The multi-year production deal with Netflix will see Rhimes\\u2019 Shondaland production company produce new series \\u201cand other projects\\u201d for the video streaming and dvd rental service. The deal doesn\\u2019t affect Grey\\u2019s Anatomy, Scandal and How to Get Away with Murder, which will continue to air in the U. S. on ABC. \\u201cShonda Rhimes is one of the greatest storytellers in the history of television,\\u201d said Ted Sarandos, Chief Content Officer, Netflix, in a statement. \\u201cHer work is gripping, inventive, pulse-pounding, heart-stopping, taboo-breaking television at its best. I\\u2019ve gotten the chance to know Shonda and she\\u2019s a true Netflixer at heart \\u2014 she loves TV and films, she cares passionately about her work, and she delivers for her audience. We\\u2019re so excited to welcome her to Netflix. \\u201dBetsy Beers, Rhimes\\u2019 longtime partner, who has helped ABC make over $2 billion from the licensing and sales of Shondaland shows, will make the move to Netflix as well. For her part, Rhimes said that the deal is the result of a \\u201cshared plan\\u201d between herself and Netflix\\u2019s Sarandos. \\u201cTed provides a clear, fearless space for creators at Netflix. He understood what I was looking for \\u2014 the opportunity to build a vibrant new storytelling home for writers with the unique creative freedom and instantaneous reach provided by Netflix\\u2019s singular sense of innovation. \\u201dWhile thanking ABC Studios president Patrick Moran and Channing Dungey, president of ABC Entertainment Group, the move to Netflix is the latest in a series of high profile acquisitions that have shaken up the entertainment landscape and a blow to ABC\\u2019s parent company. Within the past week Netflix has managed to coax talk show legend David Letterman out of retirement, snatch up the (somewhat middling) comic publishing house Millarworld for new exclusive programming, and snagged Academy Award winning writer-directors Joel and Ethan Coen for a new Western series. It\\u2019s the latest sign that the war for talent in Hollywood is well and truly on. Netflix has already spent around $6 billion this year on its original programming, and secured a $500 million line of credit earlier this year to buy even more. Meanwhile Amazon is throwing piles of its own (not-insignificant) cash horde at original programming as well. The house that Bezos built has spent about $4. 5 billion on new, original programming this year, which is hardly chump change. Meanwhile ABC\\u2019s parent company, Disney, has been spending billions of its own to roll out a new streaming service in 2019. Last year Disney bought a minority stake in BAMTech for roughly $1 billion (with an option to acquire the entire company). It\\u2019s the BAMTech service that will provide the foundation for Disney\\u2019s new streaming offering. And the company is already pushing an on-demand subscription video service for Disney movies in the UK (and briefly in China) called DisneyLife. As TechCrunch\\u2019s Sarah Perez previously reported:DisneyLife was seen as a way for Disney to experiment with streaming, before a larger public launch. This not only includes being able to test out the underlying infrastructure for such an endeavour, but also what sort of content users respond to, what features they want, how parental controls should work, and so on. On DisneyLife, consumers pay a small monthly fee that lets families of up to six stream Disney movies, TV shows, even music, audiobooks and e-books online, on mobile devices, and to TVs through AirPlay and Chromecast. If anything, DisneyLife is very much like a Disney-flavored Netflix, and could be looked to as an example of what\\u2019s to come. Terms of the deal with Netflix weren\\u2019t disclosed, but the Wall Street Journal reported that Rhimes\\u2019 ABC production deal is worth more than $10 million per year to produce shows \\u2014 and she has profit participation which means a percentage cut of all international deals and reruns.

Image: Markus Daniel / Contributor/gettyBy The Associated Press2016-06-23 20:02:20 UTCWarning: Looking at your smartphone while lying in bed at night could wreak havoc on your vision. Two women went temporarily blind from constantly checking their phones in the dark, say doctors who are now alerting others to the unusual phenomenon. The solution: Make sure to use both eyes when looking at your smartphone screen in the dark. SEE ALSO: Who cares if cellphones might cause cancer? They\\u2019re already the worst. In Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine, doctors detailed the cases of the two women, ages 22 and 40, who experienced \\\"transient smartphone blindness\\\" for months. The women complained of recurring episodes of temporary vision loss for up to 15 minutes. They were subjected to variety of medical exams, MRI scans and heart tests. Yet doctors couldn't find anything wrong with them to explain the problem. But minutes after walking into an eye specialist's office, the mystery was solved. \\\"I simply asked them, 'What exactly were you doing when this happened? '\\\" recalled Dr. Gordon Plant of Moorfield's Eye Hospital in London. Both women typically looked at their smartphones with only one eye while resting on their side in bed in the dark \\u2014 their other eye was covered by the pillow. He explained that both women typically looked at their smartphones with only one eye while resting on their side in bed in the dark \\u2014 their other eye was covered by the pillow. \\\"So you have one eye adapted to the light because it's looking at the phone and the other eye is adapted to the dark,\\\" he said. When they put their phone down, they couldn't see with the phone eye. That's because \\\"it's taking many minutes to catch up to the other eye that's adapted to the dark,\\\" Plant said. He said the temporary blindness was ultimately harmless, and easily avoidable, if people stuck to looking at their smartphones with both eyes. One of the women was relieved the short-term blindness didn't signal a more serious problem like an imminent stroke. He said the second woman was more skeptical and kept a rigorous months-long diary tracking her fleeting vision loss before she finally believed him. But she couldn't stop checking her phone for messages from bed, he said. Dr. Rahul Khurana, a spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology, called it a fascinating hypothesis but said two cases weren't enough to prove that one-eyed smartphone use in the dark caused the problem. He also doubted whether many smartphone users would experience the phenomenon. Khurana, who acknowledged that he's an avid cellphone user, said that he and his wife tried to recreate the scenario on a recent evening, but had difficulty checking their phones with only one eye. \\\"It was very odd,\\\" he said.

Cyrus Farivar - Oct 14, 2016 7:45 pm UTC Johan Larsson reader comments4Share this storyFurther ReadingAs Snapchat userbase grows, Twitter CEO calls his service \\u201cconfusing\\u201dIn the wake of Salesforce\\u2019s CEO publicly saying Friday that his company would not buy Twitter, the popular social network\\u2019s stock price has dropped more than six percent as of this writing. \\u201cIn this case we\\u2019ve walked away. It wasn\\u2019t the right fit for us,\\u201d Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff told the Financial Times. For months, rumors have swirled that numerous tech giants, ranging from Apple to Google, would snap up the San Francisco startup, which has lost nearly $2 billion from 2011 through 2015. Twitter has had a hard time attracting new users, which, in turn, has resulted in flat or slow growth. As the company noted earlier this year in its annual report:Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses, and, as of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $2. 09 billion. Although our revenue has grown rapidly, increasing from $28. 3 million in 2010 to $2. 22 billion in 2015, we expect that our revenue growth rate will slow in the future as a result of a variety of factors, including the decline in the growth rate of our user base. We believe that our future revenue growth will depend on, among other factors, our ability to attract new users, increase user engagement and ad engagement, increase our brand awareness, compete effectively, maximize our sales efforts, demonstrate a positive return on investment for advertisers, successfully develop new products and services and expand Farivar Cyrus is the Senior Business Editor at Ars Technica, and is also a radio producer and author.

Rob LeFebvre, @roblef 8m ago in TransportationComments 5SharesShareTweetShareSaveNathan Ingraham/EngadgetLast month, a Senate committee created a proposal to allow autonomous vehicles onto the roads under specific safety and \"tech neutral\" requirements. Now that the bill has hit House of Representatives, the bipartisan Energy and Commerce Committee voted to send it along to the full chamber.
